# TODO

The open list: what Termina does not do yet, or has not been checked on. It is kept in the same pull
request as the change, so an item goes when the change that closes it lands and a new one is added
with the change that leaves it open. What has shipped is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Pauta 6.1.0

The rules of [Pauta](https://pauta-project.dev/6.1.0/) not met yet, as
[`pauta.json`](src/main/resources/com/termina/pauta.json) records them and Help ▸ Pauta Conformance
shows them; tracked in [adriandeleon/Termina#92](https://github.com/adriandeleon/Termina/issues/92).
A test fails when this list and that file disagree.

### MUST

None: every MUST of the edition is met, which makes the conformance Core.

### SHOULD

- [ ] **[REL-17](https://pauta-project.dev/6.1.0/release/#rel-17)** The Windows installer is not signed.

One SHOULD is a recorded deviation and not open work:
[KBD-04](https://pauta-project.dev/6.1.0/keyboard/#kbd-04), on macOS's screen menu bar, in
[decision 0014](docs/decisions/0014-no-reason-on-a-greyed-row-of-the-macos-menu-bar.md).

Every optional rule (MAY) that applies is met.

## Never run

- [ ] **Windows.** Nothing has run there: the installer, the ConPTY path, the directory read
  (`pty.WindowsCwd`), the PowerShell toast, the shell discovery (PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL) and
  the switch to the High Contrast theme when Windows' high-contrast mode comes on. The MSI is
  unsigned.
- [ ] **macOS:** the notification and Option+drag blocks, and what the Pauta 6.0.1 work added (the
  greyed rows of the screen menu bar, the Doctor, and the Settings item of the application menu,
  which is put there through the toolkit's own classes and has never been seen).
- [ ] **The Doctor and the menus' reasons on a real desktop.** They have been seen in headless
  captures and tests only.

## Terminal

- [ ] Key bindings of more than one chord.
- [ ] Images (sixel, the kitty and iTerm2 protocols) and font ligatures.
- [ ] The emulator's gaps that nothing repairs yet, pinned in `EmulatorGapsTest`: REP, DECSLRM and
  cursor blink (`?12`).
- [ ] Restoring the tabs that were open at the last quit.

## Performance

- [ ] Damage tracking: a dirty frame redraws every visible row
  ([review of 2026-11-06](docs/reference/review-2026-11-06.md), 3.1, and the items listed as not
  done at its top).
