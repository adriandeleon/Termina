# TODO

The open list: what Termina does not do yet, or has not been checked on. It is kept in the same pull
request as the change, so an item goes when the change that closes it lands and a new one is added
with the change that leaves it open. What has shipped is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Pauta 6.0.1

The rules of [Pauta](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/) not met yet, as
[`pauta.json`](src/main/resources/com/termina/pauta.json) records them and Help ▸ Pauta Conformance
shows them; tracked in [adriandeleon/Termina#92](https://github.com/adriandeleon/Termina/issues/92).
A test fails when this list and that file disagree.

### MUST

- [ ] **[PAUTA-13](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/conformance/#pauta-13)** The website's page that lists the Pauta edition, the conformance and these exceptions is written but not published yet.
- [ ] **[DOCS-01](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/documentation/#docs-01)** The user guide's screenshots are taken but not on the website yet.
- [ ] **[DOCS-02](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/documentation/#docs-02)** The user guide's page on installing a download and checking its signature is written but not on the website yet.

### SHOULD

- [ ] **[PAUTA-14](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/conformance/#pauta-14)** The website builds its conformance page from this list, in a version of the site that is not published yet.
- [ ] **[DOCS-03](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/documentation/#docs-03)** The app opens the user guide for its own version, which the website does not serve yet.
- [ ] **[DOCS-04](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/documentation/#docs-04)** The website's What's New, command and roadmap pages are built from the app, in a version of the site that is not published yet.
- [ ] **[DOCS-18](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/documentation/#docs-18)** The website's screenshots are retaken at double size but not published yet.
- [ ] **[KBD-04](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/keyboard/#kbd-04)** On macOS a greyed row in the menu bar at the top of the screen does not say why it cannot run; every menu Termina draws itself does.
- [ ] **[PAL-08](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/templates/command-palette/#pal-08)** The Command Palette's help key opens a command's page of the user guide, which the website does not serve yet.
- [ ] **[QOPEN-01](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/templates/quick-open/#qopen-01)** There is no quick picker for themes, profiles or a setting's values; each is a separate row of the Command Palette.
- [ ] **[REL-17](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/release/#rel-17)** The Windows installer is not signed.

One optional rule is not met and has no entry there: window modes that hide chrome
([WIN-10](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/window-shell/#win-10)).

## Never run

- [ ] **Windows.** Nothing has run there: the installer, the ConPTY path, the directory read
  (`pty.WindowsCwd`), the PowerShell toast, the shell discovery (PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL) and
  the switch to the High Contrast theme when Windows' high-contrast mode comes on. The MSI is
  unsigned.
- [ ] **macOS:** the notification and Option+drag blocks, and what the Pauta 6.0.1 work added (the
  greyed rows of the screen menu bar, the Doctor, and the Settings item of the application menu,
  which is put there through the toolkit's own classes and has never been seen).
- [ ] **The Doctor and the menus' reasons on a real desktop.** They have been seen in headless
  captures and tests only.

## Terminal

- [ ] Key bindings of more than one chord.
- [ ] Images (sixel, the kitty and iTerm2 protocols) and font ligatures.
- [ ] The emulator's gaps that nothing repairs yet, pinned in `EmulatorGapsTest`: REP, DECSLRM and
  cursor blink (`?12`).
- [ ] Restoring the tabs that were open at the last quit.

## Performance

- [ ] Damage tracking: a dirty frame redraws every visible row
  ([review of 2026-11-06](docs/reference/review-2026-11-06.md), 3.1, and the items listed as not
  done at its top).
