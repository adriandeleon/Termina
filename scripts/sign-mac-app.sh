# Signs the finished Termina.app with a Developer ID Application identity, hardened runtime and a
# secure timestamp: what Apple's notarization asks for.
#
# Runs only when TERMINA_MAC_SIGN_IDENTITY names the identity. release.yml's macOS leg imports the
# certificate into a throw-away keychain and exports it, with that keychain in TERMINA_MAC_KEYCHAIN.
# Anywhere else (a local build, CI, a dry run without the secrets) this is a no-op and the bundle keeps
# the ad-hoc signature fix-mac-bundle-version.sh gave it.
#
# Order matters. It runs after every edit to the bundle (the notices, the AOT cache and the
# Info.plist version all change it) and before build-installers.sh wraps it, and it signs
# inside-out, as codesign requires: every loose Mach-O file (the runtime's dylibs, jspawnhelper),
# then the nested runtime bundle, then the app. --deep is not used for signing: it would give every
# nested binary the app's entitlements.
#
# Usage: sign-mac-app.sh <app-bundle>
