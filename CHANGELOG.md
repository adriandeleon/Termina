# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html); until 1.0.0 the minor number
moves for anything user-visible. Each entry opens with a bold one-line summary.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The find bar's arrows wear the Find Next and Find Previous icons**, the ones their rows in the
  menus show, instead of arrows of their own. And Find Next's icon now points up: it steps to older
  output, up the scrollback, where it used to point down.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-11-14

Termina is built to [Pauta 6.0.1](https://pauta-project.dev/6.0.1/) now, at Core conformance, and
most of this release came from getting there. A status bar and a Message Log. Settings in JSON,
with export, import and a sync that carries a changed shortcut to every system. The tabs you had
open back at the next launch, pinned tabs, pickers, three window modes, a High Contrast theme and
an interface zoom. A terminal a screen reader can read. A user guide for this version is on the
website, and Help opens it. A great deal of what a user sees changed, so the minor number moves.

Also here: the quick fixes from the
[2026-11-06 performance review](docs/reference/review-2026-11-06.md) and its settings-layer items;
the larger ones there (damage tracking, the theme stylesheets' size) are not done.

### Added

- **Three window modes**, in the View menu, the Command Palette and bindable under Settings ▸
  Keyboard:
  - **Zen Mode** hides the window's menu bar, tab strip and status bar and leaves the terminal
    alone.
  - **Expert Mode** hides the menu bar and the tab strip and keeps the status bar.
  - **Simple Mode** keeps everything and shortens the menu bar to four menus of everyday
    commands, for someone new to Termina. It is also Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ Simple mode.

  Zen and Expert belong to one window, last until it closes and change no setting, so leaving
  the mode brings back exactly what was there. With the menu bar hidden the way out is the
  Command Palette, which lists Leave Zen Mode or Leave Expert Mode, and the Message Log says so
  when the mode starts. Simple Mode is a setting and applies to every window. In every mode each
  command keeps its chord and its row in the palette. On macOS the menus are in the screen's menu
  bar, which Zen and Expert do not hide.
- **Pickers: a list to type into for a choice from a list.** Four commands, in the Command
  Palette and bindable under Settings ▸ Keyboard: **Select Color Theme**, **Select Font**,
  **Select Cursor Shape** and **New Tab from Profile**. Each opens on the value in force. Type to
  narrow the list, move with the arrows or Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P, Enter chooses, Escape or Ctrl+G
  cancels. Select Color Theme shows each theme in the window as you move to it and puts back the
  one you had if you cancel.
- **Cancelling a list is a command, Cancel List**, on Ctrl+G by default and bindable under
  Settings ▸ Keyboard like the four that move a line and a page. The Command Palette, the pickers
  and the Message Log all close on its chord, and on Escape whatever is bound. Ctrl+G was fixed in
  the palette before, and with the terminal in front it stays the shell's.
- **The Message Log moves on Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P and closes on Ctrl+G**, the keys of the palette
  and the pickers, or whichever chords you have given those commands.
- **A help key in the Command Palette.** Ctrl+H opens the highlighted command's page of the user
  guide in your browser; the palette stays open. It is F1, or Shift+F1, if you have given Ctrl+H
  to a command. The palette's legend names the key.
- **A High Contrast theme**: white on black, a single cyan accent, and every colour of the
  terminal and of the windows at 7:1 or better on the black. Choose it like any theme. On Windows,
  Termina switches to it while the system's high-contrast mode is on and back to your own theme
  when it ends; that switch has not yet been run on Windows.
- **The tabs you had open come back at the next launch.** Each tab and pane reopens as a new
  shell in the folder it was in, with the names you gave, the pinned tabs pinned and the same tab
  in front. The programs that were running are not started again, and a tab opened with `-e` comes
  back as a shell. It is the last window's tabs when the last window closes, and the front
  window's on Quit. Settings ▸ Terminal ▸ Reopen tabs at launch turns it off, and
  **`--no-session`** skips it for one launch. With a session restored, `-d`, `-T` or `-e` on the
  command line open a tab of their own after it.
- **Each page of Settings ends in a link to its help:** Help for Appearance, Help for Profiles and
  so on, opening that page of the documentation.
- **`TODO.md`** is the open list: the Pauta rules not met yet, what has never been run, and the
  terminal features not done. It changes in the same pull request as the work.
- **Help ▸ Doctor** checks what Termina relies on: the shell it starts, its settings folder, Git
  and the GitHub CLI for settings sync, and on Linux the tools for the selection clipboard,
  notifications and opening links. Each row says OK, Missing, Optional or Problem in words, with
  what was found, and a row that is not OK says what to install and links to it. Check Again
  re-runs it; Copy as text gives the rows for a bug report.
- **`--dev`** keeps a separate set of settings in `~/.termina-dev`, so a build being tried out never
  touches the ones in daily use. `--config-dir` still takes precedence, and `--dev` wins over
  `TERMINA_CONFIG_DIR`: what is typed on the command line is the more specific instruction.
- **The Debug Log can be exported** to a file, and the previous session's log is kept beside this
  one's as `termina-session.prev.log`.
- **Help ▸ Documentation and Help ▸ What's New** open the user documentation and this version's
  release notes.
- **Export and Import Configuration.** Settings ▸ Advanced and the palette save a timestamped
  `.zip` of your settings, key bindings, shell profiles and imported themes to your home folder, and
  restore from one. The import lists the parts the zip holds and replaces only the ones you leave
  ticked; window positions and the settings-sync connection stay as they are. Your current
  configuration is copied to `backups/` in the config folder first. A zip that is not an export, or
  that a newer Termina wrote, is refused before anything changes.
- **Find in the Debug Log.** A find bar across the top of the window, opened by the Find… button,
  Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on macOS) or the new Find in Debug Log command: it searches as you type, counts the
  matches, steps with Enter and Shift+Enter, and closes on Escape. All lower case matches either
  case; a capital makes it exact.
- **A filter in the Message Log.** A field over the list narrows it to the messages that have every
  word typed. Escape empties it, and from an empty filter goes back to the list. Ctrl+F (Cmd+F)
  puts the keyboard in it.
- **The two log windows have right-click menus, and their buttons are commands**: Refresh, Copy,
  Export and Clear for the Debug Log, Copy and Clear for the Message Log, in the palette and
  bindable on the Keyboard page. The Debug Log's Copy takes the selected text when there is some.
- **Hide Tab Bar.** View ▸ Hide Tab Bar, the same command in the palette, and a row on Settings ▸
  Appearance ▸ Tabs hide the row of tabs however many are open; the older setting only hid it for a
  single tab. The tabs are still reached by their shortcuts, the tab menu and the palette.
- **Focus Menu Bar** (Ctrl+Shift+F10) puts the keyboard in the menu bar and opens its first menu,
  so the arrow keys walk it. A plain F10 and a lone Alt, which do this in most apps, belong to the
  program running in the terminal.
- **`-Dtermina.stallLog` says where, not only for how long.** While the UI thread is stuck, a
  watcher prints its stack, once for each stall, before the line that reports the gap.
- **Interface zoom.** Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ Window ▸ Interface zoom, from 80% to 200%, makes the
  menus, the tab strip, the status bar, the palette and every other window larger or smaller, at
  once. Zoom Interface In, Zoom Interface Out and Reset Interface Zoom are in the palette and can be
  given shortcuts on the Keyboard page. The terminal's text is not touched: Zoom In, Zoom Out and
  Actual Size, and their shortcuts, are still its own.
- **`termina-cli.exe`, on Windows.** `Termina.exe` is a window program and has no console, so
  `--help`, `--version` and `--report` printed nothing in the terminal they were typed in. The
  installer now carries a second launcher that prints there; with no such option it opens a window
  as `Termina.exe` does.
- **Help ▸ Pauta Conformance.** A window that says which edition of
  [Pauta](https://pauta-project.dev/) Termina follows and how far it has got: Complete, Core or
  Partial, and under that every rule it does not meet yet, each with a one-line reason, a link to
  the rule and a link to the issue that tracks it. Copy as text puts the list on the clipboard as
  Markdown. About says the same in one line, which opens the window, and the block that Copy
  Details and Report a Problem include now carries it. Also in the palette: Pauta Conformance,
  Pauta Conformance in the Docs and Copy Pauta Conformance.
- **Quit.** File ▸ Quit Termina, and the Quit Termina command in the palette, close every window
  and end the app. If a program is still running in any tab of any window it asks first, once,
  with Cancel as the default. The macOS application menu's Quit and the Dock's now ask that one
  question too, where each window used to ask for itself.
- **Right-click menus show shortcuts**, as the menu bar does: a tab's menu, the terminal's, the two
  log windows' and the profile list's show the shortcut each command is on now, and follow one
  moved on the Keyboard page.
- **The buttons of Settings, Report a Problem and About are commands**, in the palette and bindable
  on the Keyboard page: Reset All Settings, Import Theme, Remove Theme, Reset All Shortcuts, Add
  Profile, Remove Profile, Connect Settings Sync (which reads Disconnect once connected), Create
  Sync Repository on GitHub, Cancel Sync, Sync Anyway, Remove Credentials From Sync Address, Copy
  Problem Report, Open Issue for Problem Report, Copy Version Details, Open Termina's Website,
  Source Code and Releases, and Pauta Guidelines. Each Settings command opens Settings on its page
  and does what the button does, questions included; one that cannot run is greyed in the palette
  with the reason.
- **A right-click menu on the profile list** in Settings, with Add and Remove.
- **A right-click row that discards something is drawn in the danger colour**: Clear Scrollback,
  Clear in the two log windows, and Remove in the profile list.
- **Toggle Regular Expression is a command**: in the palette, and bindable on the Keyboard page.
  It flips the find bar's `.*` switch, opening the bar first if it is closed. The switch could only
  be clicked.
- **Open Link and Copy Link Address are commands**, for the link under the pointer: in the palette,
  and bindable on the Keyboard page, as well as on the right-click menu.
- **One Termina per config folder.** Launching it again opens a new window in the running Termina,
  with that launch's `-d`, `-e` and `-T`, in the directory it was launched from; the second process
  exits as soon as the first has the request. `--new-instance` starts a separate one.
- **Report a Problem.** Help ▸ Report a Problem, and a button in the Debug Log, build a report of
  the session — version, Java, OS, the settings worth knowing, the end of the Debug Log — with your
  home folder, user name, addresses, credentials and tokens taken out. It is shown for you to read
  and edit, copied to the clipboard, and opened as a GitHub issue with the bug form filled in;
  nothing is sent until you submit it. A report too long for the link leaves a note in the issue's
  report field saying to paste it. `termina --report` does the same without the window, from the
  last session's log: it writes the report to a file in the current folder (the temp folder where
  that one cannot be written), prints the file's path and opens the issue.
- **An optional status bar, and a Message Log.** Settings ▸ Appearance or View ▸ Show Status Bar
  turns on a row under the terminal that says what the last command reported: red for an error,
  amber for a warning, with a count of errors not yet seen. It is off by default. Help ▸ Message Log
  lists everything Termina reported this session, with times, whether the bar is on or not. Help ▸
  Debug Log opens the Debug Log, which was only on the Advanced page. A crash says so in the log
  too, pointing at the Debug Log. Once the update check has found a newer version the bar names it
  in a link that opens its release, until the link is followed.
- **Pinned tabs.** Pin Tab, in the Window menu, a tab's own menu and the palette, moves a tab to the
  pinned group at the left and marks it with a pin and a bold title. Close Other Tabs and the other
  bulk closes pass over it, and Reopen Closed Tab brings it back pinned. Closing it by itself still
  works.
- **A theme that follows the system.** "Follow the System" in Settings, a profile's theme picker and
  the palette uses Editora Light while the desktop is light and Editora Dark while it is dark, and
  switches when the desktop does.
- **Close Other Tabs, Close Tabs to the Left and Close Tabs to the Right are commands**: in the File
  menu and the palette, bindable on the Keyboard page, and greyed with the reason while they would
  close nothing. Close Tabs to the Left is new, on a tab's menu too. Configure Profiles is a command
  as well, and opens Settings on the Profiles page.
- **About names the Pauta edition Termina follows, and what it runs on.** A "Working toward Pauta
  6.0.1" link to that edition's guidelines ("Built to" once every MUST is met), the Java and JavaFX versions, and a Copy details button
  that copies everything `termina --version` now prints (version, build, Pauta edition, Java,
  JavaFX, OS) for a bug report. A "Source code and releases" link is always there, not only when
  an update is.
- **About and `--version` name the commit a build came from**, with `-dirty` for a build from
  uncommitted changes. A build from a source archive, with no repository, names none.

### Changed

- **Termina is built to Pauta 6.0.1 at Core conformance**: every MUST of the edition is met. One
  SHOULD is pending, the Windows installer's signature, and one is a recorded deviation: on macOS a
  greyed row in the screen's menu bar does not say why it cannot run, because the system draws
  that bar; the Command Palette does. About and Help ▸ Pauta Conformance say "Built to Pauta
  6.0.1" where they said "Working toward". The last three MUSTs were the user guide on the
  website: its pictures of the real window, its Installing page and its conformance page.
- **An imported colour scheme is stored as JSON.** A theme is `themes/<name>.json` in the settings
  folder, where it was `<name>.properties`. Each theme you have is rewritten the first time
  Termina starts, under the same name, and the file it was is kept beside it as
  `<name>.properties.migrated`. Nothing that uses a theme changes. A configuration zip exported
  by an older Termina still imports. The settings, the window state and the session's tabs are
  read and written by Jackson as plain classes now and look the same on disk.
- **Help opens the guide for the version you are running.** Documentation, the Help link on each
  page of Settings and the Pauta window's link open `termina-project.dev/docs/v-<version>/`, where
  they opened the newest guide whatever the version.
- **The palette's movement keys can be changed.** Moving a line and a page in the Command
  Palette are four commands now, Line Down, Line Up, Page Down and Page Up, under Settings ▸
  Keyboard: Ctrl+N, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+V and Alt+V as before, until you move them. The arrows and Page
  Up and Page Down always work. Their keys act only in a list, so in the terminal Ctrl+N and
  Ctrl+P still reach the shell. Run from the palette, the four scroll the terminal's history.
- **How to install a download and check its signature is on the website**, in the user guide's
  Installing page, and no longer in the repository's `docs/`.
- **Settings sync carries a changed shortcut to every system.** Key bindings sync as one file
  where there was one for macOS and one for Windows and Linux, so a shortcut you change on a Mac
  changes on your Linux and Windows computers, and the other way. Command on a Mac is Ctrl+Shift
  elsewhere: `Cmd+K` there is `Ctrl+Shift+K` here. Update every computer that shares a sync
  repository: one still on an older Termina will say the repository is newer than it is and stop
  syncing until it is updated. Two computers that had each changed the same command will disagree
  once, and the one that syncs second wins.
- **On macOS, Settings is in the application menu**, under About, where every Mac app has it. It
  shows the shortcut bound to Settings and follows it when you change it. The File menu keeps
  its row. This has not yet been run on a Mac.
- **Every command's id has its area in front**: `file.newTab`, `edit.copy`, `tab.next`,
  `pane.splitRight`, `view.zoomIn`, `sync.now`. Nothing on screen changes. The ids are what
  `settings.json` keeps your key bindings under (`keys.file.newTab`) and what settings sync
  writes; both are carried forward when read, and `settings.json` moves to schema version 3. A
  computer still on an older Termina does not know the new ids, so update every computer that
  shares a sync repository.
- **The Message Log opens inside the window**, as a card over the terminal just above the status
  bar, not as a window of its own. Escape, a click outside it or its own command closes it, and
  the keyboard goes back to the terminal. It keeps the newest 200 messages of the session; it
  kept 500.
- **Programs Termina starts get your login shell's `PATH` from the start.** It is asked for once,
  in the background, after the first window is drawn. Before, a notification or a middle-click
  paste got it only after a sync or a clicked link had asked.
- **Repainting a screen that has not changed allocates almost nothing.** Each frame used to copy
  every run of text on screen to a new string, and the emulator's own walk over the rows made more
  for each row: about 12,700 bytes a frame on a full coloured screen, sixty times a second while a
  cursor blinks or a selection is dragged. The text a frame draws is now kept from the frame
  before, and the rows are read directly: about 900 bytes, measured by a test.
- **The README's picture is the current window, dark and light, at 2×,** shown by the page's
  colour scheme. `scripts/screenshots.sh` retakes both from the real window with no window opened
  on the desktop, and `-Dtermina.captureScale=2` does the same for any capture.
- **The tests wait for what they need instead of sleeping.** Fifty-five fixed and polling sleeps
  are gone: a test waits on the next frame, on a signal the code under test fires, or on a
  worker's own queue. Two of them had been hiding a test that typed its commands onto a
  half-finished line, so the mouse modes it meant to exercise were never set; its keys and
  mouse reports now go to a loop that reads them, not to the shell's prompt.
- **A greyed menu row says why.** Rest the pointer on a command a menu has greyed and a tooltip
  gives the reason the command palette gives: no tab has been closed, this is the only tab, there
  is no link under the pointer. In the menu bar's menus, a tab's menu and the terminal's
  right-click menu; not in the macOS screen menu bar, whose rows are the system's.
- **Open Link and Copy Link Address are always in the right-click menu,** greyed where there is no
  link, in a group of their own after Select All. They used to appear at the top only over a link.
- **Move Tab Left and Move Tab Right are greyed at the ends of the strip,** in the Window menu and
  the palette as well as in a tab's own menu, and a tab's Close Other Tabs is greyed when every
  other tab is pinned, as the palette's already was.
- **A quicker start.** The settings are read on a thread of their own while JavaFX starts, not
  after it, and release builds carry their stylesheets precompiled, so they are loaded without
  being parsed.
- **The font picker's list is made in the background** after the first frame. Working out which
  installed fonts are monospace used to happen when Settings first opened, and held the window for
  a quarter of a second on a machine with many fonts.
- **The status bar is shown, and on Windows and Linux the menu bar is in the title bar, unless you
  turn them off.** Both were options that started off. If you never changed either you will see
  both after this update: a row under the terminal that says what the last command reported, where
  a dialog used to appear, and one row at the top holding the menus, the title and the window
  buttons. View ▸ Hide Status Bar and Settings ▸ Appearance ▸ Window put either back. A setting you
  had already chosen is left as it is.
- **The on and off rows of Settings are switches.** Tab reaches each one, Space or Enter flips it,
  and a screen reader announces it as a toggle with its state; they were check boxes.
- **A screen reader can read the terminal.** The terminal is announced as a text area named
  Terminal whose text is what is on screen. The status bar's message is announced as a button that
  opens the Message Log, and the Command Palette says which row is highlighted and why a greyed
  one cannot run.
- **A settings sync that fails on its own says so.** A failed automatic sync, or one started on
  the Settings page, now goes to the Message Log and the status bar, once per kind of failure; it
  used to show only on the Sync page. That page has a status pill: Off, Synced, Syncing or Problem.
- **An open Command Palette follows a change of key bindings**, its rows and its own shortcut
  included.
- **A tab's marks differ by shape as well as color**: a dot for new output, a ring for the bell, a
  diamond for a program asking for attention. In gray they were three identical dots.
- **Counts read right for one.** "1 unread error", "1 file", in every language; they were worded
  for several whatever the count.
- **Closing the Command Palette gives the keyboard back to where it was.** Opened from the find
  bar's field, it returns there; it used to return to the terminal every time.
- **The menu bar and the tab strip are one band**, on one background with no line between them, and
  a menu is a card with rounder corners and a deeper shadow.
- **Command Palette is the first row of the Help menu**, where the guidelines put it; it was in View.
- **The Message Log follows the key bindings.** The shortcut bound to Copy copies its selected
  lines, as Ctrl+C (Cmd+C) still does. Ctrl+G no longer closes it: Escape does, and so does going
  back to the window behind.
- **The visual bell does not flash while the system asks for reduced motion.** The tab is still
  marked.
- **About shows an available update in bold amber and a failed check in red**; the links keep the
  accent color.
- **Removing a profile says that it cannot be undone**, and Sync Anyway is drawn as the dangerous
  button it is. Clear Scrollback is red in the Edit menu, as it was in the right-click menu.
- **Shortcut names are not translated.** Ctrl and Shift read the same in every language; a few
  German, Spanish, French and Italian strings said Strg, Umschalt, Mayús, Maj or Maiusc.
- **A middle-click pastes nothing on macOS and Windows.** It pasted the clipboard there. On Linux
  it pastes the primary selection, as before; the three systems differ in this and it is Linux's
  alone.
- **A tab's folder is read the same way on every system.** The operating system is asked where the
  shell is, and what the shell reports about itself (OSC 7, OSC 9;9) fills in only where the system
  has no answer, which is a WSL tab. On Windows a report used to win over the system's answer for
  every tab.
- **Every menu row has an icon.** About half of the menu bar's rows had an empty icon column, and
  Copy Link Address borrowed Copy's. Each command a menu lists now has a picture of its own, in the
  bar, the right-click menus, a tab's menu, the two logs' and the profile list's.
- **Zoom In, Zoom Out and Actual Size are rows of the View menu**, each with its icon and its
  shortcut, on every system as they already were on macOS. The row of four buttons is the
  right-click menu's alone.
- **File ▸ New Tab With lists the first nine profiles**, the ones with a shortcut. A tenth onwards
  is in the tab strip's drop-down and the palette, as all of them are.
- **The coverage floors are one set of numbers in the build.** No Windows profile lowers them; the
  Windows CI runner passes its own on its command line.
- **Termina follows Pauta 6.0.1** (it named 2.0.2), and says "working toward" it: the rules it does
  not meet yet are listed in Help ▸ Pauta Conformance, and the README's badge carries the same
  word. The list is `pauta.json`, and a test holds it, the README and About to one answer.
- **Enter no longer confirms a removal.** On every question with a red button — removing a theme or
  a profile, resetting the settings or the key bindings, Import Configuration — Cancel is the
  default button, and the red action runs only from itself: a click, or Tab to it and Space.
- **Five commands have new ids**, the ones Pauta names: `help.about` (was `about`), `palette.show`
  (`commandPalette`), `help.documentation` (`documentation`), `view.messageLog` (`messageLog`) and
  `find.show` (`find`).
  A key binding is stored under its command's id, so `settings.json` moves to `schemaVersion` 2 and
  a `keys.commandPalette` line becomes `keys.palette.show` when the file is read; a
  `settings.properties` from before 0.15 is brought forward the same way. Settings sync reads the
  old ids as the new ones, so a repository shared with a computer on an older Termina keeps
  working; that older Termina does not know the new ids, and puts those five commands back on
  their default chords once a newer one has synced.
- **Find, run while the find bar is open, steps to the next match** and puts the keyboard back in
  the field. It used to only do the second.
- **A click on the status bar opens the Message Log through its command**, like the menu row.
- **A dialog's buttons are in the same order on every OS**: Cancel to the left of the action.
  JavaFX orders them by OS, which on Windows put the action first.
- **Hide Menu Bar is in the menus on macOS too, greyed.** The View menu's row and the terminal's
  right-click checkbox were left out there, and the command was missing from the palette; they are
  there now, disabled, and the palette says why: the menus are in the screen menu bar.
- **The sync repository and branch are saved as they are typed in**, on Enter or when the focus
  leaves the field, not only by Connect; an address or branch that cannot work is marked and not
  saved. **A shell path that names nothing, or a file that cannot run, is marked and no longer
  saved**: the setting keeps the last path that passed. A profile's command and starting directory
  follow the same rule.
- **An imported theme's file names its `schemaVersion`**, like the settings file. One a newer
  Termina wrote is kept as `<name>.properties.v<n>.bak` and not read; a file from before the
  version reads as it did.
- **Settings ▸ Advanced opens the same Debug Log as Help ▸ Debug Log**, with Report a Problem on it.
  It used to open a second window that lacked the button.
- **Every prompt's buttons are in Termina's language**: Rename Tab's Cancel, and both buttons where
  a command asks for a setting's value or Settings asks for a repository's name, were JavaFX's own,
  worded in the system's language.
- **Configure Profiles has one icon.** Its row under the new-tab chevron wore the Settings gear.
- **`--add-exports`, `--add-opens` and `-p` on the command line are skipped with their values**, not
  refused as unknown options: a launcher can leave them among the program's arguments.
- **The last disk work is off the window's thread.** Listening for other launches (a stale socket
  file removed, a new one bound) and the fonts registered after the first frame each have a thread
  of their own; the profile list no longer asks the disk whether each shell can run every time a
  menu is built, but keeps the answers, worked out on a worker; Settings checks a shell path, a
  profile's command and its folder on a worker, so the mark and the save come a moment after the
  key; and settings sync writes its backup on its own thread.
- **A program that floods desktop notifications or clipboard writes no longer queues one piece of
  work each for the window.** They, and uncaught errors, reach it in batches a frame apart.
- **One place says which operating system this is** (`com.termina.Os`); twenty classes worked it
  out for themselves, in three spellings. No behaviour changes.
- **Nothing that touches the disk or the process table runs on the window's thread any more**, so a
  slow disk or a hung network mount cannot freeze the window. A new tab appears at once and its
  shell a moment later; the close prompt, the scrollback search and the check behind a hovered
  file path wait off to the side; and the settings and fonts are read before the window is built.
- **The menu bar's shortcuts line up in a column**, with each command's icon beside it where the
  right-click menus have one. On macOS the shortcut follows the title in the screen menu bar. The
  menus no longer use accelerators, so a shortcut is only ever run by Termina's own key handling.
- **The multi-line paste and close-a-running-program questions look like the rest**: the app's own
  fonts and colours, as the Settings window's questions already had. Resetting a key binding that
  takes its chord from another command says so with a danger-styled Reset.
- **Every setting is in the palette.** Type part of a setting's name: a switch says which way it
  will go ("Show a scrollbar: turn off"), a choice lists its options ("Cursor shape: Bar"), and a
  value ("Scrollback lines…") asks for a new one. Each is named and described as its Settings row is.
- **The palette lists every command.** Go to Tab and New Tab With Profile are listed for every
  number with a shortcut, greyed with the reason when there is no such tab or profile, and the
  palette lists itself. At an equal match a command that can run comes before one that cannot.
- **One right-click menu at a time.** Opening a tab's menu, a pane's or the profile list closes any
  other that is open, however it was opened.
- **The command palette is built the first time it opens**, not with every window.
- **A release checks the macOS app is signed by Termina's team and launches the notarized app**
  from its dmg, as well as the image before it was wrapped.
- **A slow answer can no longer overwrite a newer one**: importing a theme or a configuration
  twice, the GitHub check behind Settings ▸ Sync and the update check each apply only the latest
  request's result.
- **The Menu key and Shift+F10 open the terminal's menu**, under the cursor, as GNOME Terminal's
  do; plain F10 still reaches the program. **Tab Menu**, in the palette and bindable, opens the
  current tab's own menu.
- **About Termina is in the macOS application menu** as well as in Help.
- **Tooltips name the command and the shortcut in force**: the zoom row's buttons say "Zoom In
  (Ctrl+=)", the find bar's arrows "Find Next" and "Find Previous" and its `.*` switch "Toggle
  Regular Expression", each with its chord, and they follow a chord moved on the Keyboard page.
- **Shortcuts are drawn in one colour everywhere**: the menu bar's and the right-click menus'
  shortcut column, the palette's shortcuts and its chip. It is Editora's periwinkle, lighter on a
  dark theme and a deep ink on a light one; the palette's chip was the accent colour and the menu
  bar's shortcuts the muted text colour.
- **Settings search finds a row by what its controls show**: a button's label, a choice's options,
  a field's prompt. Typing a theme's name finds the Theme row, and "import" the rows with an
  Import button, in whatever language the interface is in.
- **Settings search ranks what it finds**: a title above a description above a section heading
  above a keyword, and a whole word above part of one. Section headings and page names are
  searched, and every word typed has to be found.
- **A very large paste asks first and shows only its start.** Past a million characters it asks
  whether or not it has line breaks; past sixteen million, or more than memory can hold on the way
  out, it is refused with a message. The prompt's preview stops at 64K characters.
- **The session log stays under 8 MB**, cut back to its newest half with a line saying what went,
  and the Debug Log and Message Log say how many older entries they have dropped.
- **The Debug Log keeps everything logged, not just warnings and errors**, including what JediTerm
  and pty4j log, which used to go to a stderr nobody saw in an installed app. A desktop
  notification that could not be shown now says why in it.
- **Closing a tab with a program still running shows its Close button in the danger style.**
- **A release's notes are its section of this changelog**, under the install instructions, rather
  than a list of commit subjects. A tag whose version has no section here fails before building.
- **The multi-line paste prompt can no longer be switched off from Settings.** A setting that only
  makes Termina less safe is a `settings.json` key instead: `"input.confirmPaste": false`.
- **The Help menu is in Pauta's order:** Keyboard Shortcuts, Check for Updates, Message Log, Debug
  Log, then About.
- **The window themes come through AtlantaFX**, the theme library the Editora themes were drawn
  from, now a dependency rather than only their source. If a build ever lacks its Editora sheet,
  AtlantaFX's own Primer theme of the same lightness draws the windows instead of nothing.
- **Settings are JSON, with a schema version.** `~/.termina/settings.json` holds preferences and
  `workspace-state.json` the window's place and size and the update check's memory. Each names its
  `schemaVersion`. The keys are the same dotted names, one per line. A `settings.properties` from
  an earlier version is imported on the first launch and kept as `settings.properties.migrated`. A
  file a newer Termina wrote is kept as `settings.json.v<n>.bak` rather than read, and one that is
  not valid JSON as `settings.json.corrupt.bak`; either way Termina opens on defaults. Hand-editing
  a Windows path now means JSON's doubled backslashes.
- **The default shortcuts are data.** `keymaps/keymap.json` (Windows and Linux) and
  `keymap.mac.json` hold every command's default chord, which used to be written into the code. No
  shortcut changes.
- **The first window waits on less.** Only the fonts and window icons it draws are loaded before it
  shows; the other bundled font families and the large icons follow the first frame, and the daily
  update check waits three seconds after it. Measured headless, four runs each: about 20 ms off a
  start of roughly 470 ms.
- **The Debug Log's file and a theme's removal no longer write to disk on the interface thread.**
- **New Tab wears the same + in the menus as on the tab strip.**
- **A keyboard focus ring in Settings and the dialogs.** A control reached with Tab draws a 2px
  accent ring; a click draws none. Check boxes and links showed no focus at all before.
- **Warnings and errors in Settings use the theme's readable text colours**, named once as state
  colours. The amber "chord already taken" read at under 3:1 on the light theme.
- **Removing a theme, a profile or a token in the sync address asks first.** Each deleted what the
  user had made at a click, with no way back but making it again.
- **Reopen Closed Tab reaches back twenty tabs instead of ten.**
- **The light Editora theme matches Editora's again.** Its accent, warning and success text had
  kept the colours Editora later darkened, which read below 4.5:1 on their tinted backgrounds. The
  About credits, the settings path and the Settings sidebar headings move from the faintest text
  colour to the muted one for the same reason.
- **Every control has a name a screen reader can read.** The menu bar's rows were announced as
  nothing, being drawn from an icon, a title and a shortcut rather than as text; so were the find
  bars' and the palette's fields, the search fields of Settings and Keyboard Shortcuts, the lists
  in Settings, the Message Log and the palette, the text of the Debug Log and of Report a Problem,
  the window opacity slider, the field of the Rename Tab and other prompts, and the preview in the
  paste question. A test now opens every window, menu and dialog and fails on a control without
  one.
- **Icon-only buttons have names a screen reader can read.** The new-tab and profile buttons, the
  tabs' close buttons, the find bar's buttons and the zoom row's buttons carried a tooltip and
  nothing else.

- **The settings file is written once per run of changes, not once per change.** Every setter
  wrote the whole file, under a file lock, on the thread that called it, so a spinner held down, the
  zoom chord under key auto-repeat and the opacity slider's arrow keys wrote it per tick. A change
  still applies live — memory and every window see it at once — and the file is written 300 ms
  after the last change in a run, off the FX thread; whatever is pending is written when the app
  quits. The Settings window also stops rebuilding all of its controls for a change one of them has
  just made: a tick re-set thirty controls, resolved every key binding four times and rebuilt the
  profile list and the preview, for a value the control was already showing. A change from
  elsewhere still reloads it.

- **Less work per frame and per write.** The scrollbar is updated after the buffer lock is released
  rather than inside it; whether type-ahead is wanted is decided when the foreground program
  changes, not on every buffer write (3% of the emulator thread in a profile); the prompt-mark list
  is copied when it changes, not on every frame; the search overlay's colours are derived once per
  theme.
- **A settings write no longer restyles and repaints every pane whose colours did not change.**
  `setPalette` and the cursor-shape setter short-circuit on an unchanged value, the menu bar's and
  tab strip's style classes are touched only when they change, and the theme lookup no longer
  builds four entries and a list per call.
- **Removed members nothing called:** `TerminalView.getFontSize`, `isSearchShowing`, the
  `setSessionOptions(int, String)` overload, `FxTerminalDisplay.getMouseFormat`,
  `AppInfo.isSnapshot`, `LaunchOptions.withProfileId`, `SettingsWindow.matches`,
  `Theme.byDisplayName`, four unused `MenuIcons` glyphs, `SettingsSync.secondary`,
  `CommandPalette.show(List)`; and ten Javadoc blocks that documented nothing.

- **Builds and releases check more before they finish.** The build refuses a JDK older than 25
  and a Maven outside 3.9; the JavaFX tests run on the headless platform everywhere and are tagged,
  so `./mvnw test -DexcludedGroups=fx` runs the rest alone; CI has a separate Format check; a
  release stops before publishing if any download is missing or unexpected, attests the checksums
  file as well as the downloads, runs as a full dry run when started by hand, and opens the pull
  request that starts the next snapshot.

### Fixed

- **A profile's folder could be undone by the edit before it.** In Settings ▸ Profiles, changing
  the command and then the folder a moment later could leave the folder as it was: each edit
  checks its paths on its own thread, and the first edit's answer sometimes arrived last and was
  written over the second. Only the newest edit of a profile is applied now.
- **Settings sync's `gh` is given the login shell's `PATH`,** as `git` already was: started from a
  desktop launcher, a `gh` installed by Homebrew could be found and then fail to find `git`. The
  link opener and the desktop's own tools (`xclip`, `notify-send`) get it too once it is known.
- **A desktop notification that could not be shown says why in the Debug Log**: no `notify-send` or
  `gdbus` to post it with, a tool that did not answer in five seconds, or one that exited with an
  error. Only an exception was logged.
- **The rename prompt, the shell-failure message and two more dialogs draw in the interface font.**
  They were in the platform's.
- **"Go to Tab" and "Go to Last Tab" are spelled right in French and Italian.** The apostrophe was
  missing from "l'onglet" and "all'ultima".
- **`--help` lines up.** The `--new-instance` and `--dev` rows sat ten columns left of the rest.
- **A click on the tab strip closes a tab's right-click menu.** The menu stayed up through a press
  on the strip it was opened on, and now closes on a press anywhere in the window.
- **A click that closes the terminal's right-click menu now also acts.** It was swallowed, so
  closing the menu cost a click; a right-click elsewhere now reopens the menu there.
- **About no longer says "You are up to date" when nothing has checked.** It said so whenever no
  newer release was known — before the day's check had run, after it had failed, and with checks
  turned off. It now says which of those it is, and claims up to date only on an answer from this
  session.
- **The Keyboard page's "Press a shortcut…" prompt shows while recording.** Its rule was in the
  stylesheet the terminal windows load, not the one the settings window does, so a focused
  recording field was a blank box. The Debug Log window's path label had the opposite problem and
  is styled now.
- **A settings change from elsewhere no longer overwrites what is being typed into the settings
  window.** A sync run finishing, or a zoom chord in a terminal window, reloads the window; the
  shell, link-command and sync fields keep their text while they have the focus.
- **About has a palette description**, like every other command. Its text was translated and
  never read.
- **A capture run can answer the paste prompt** (`-Dtermina.capturePasteAnswer=paste|cancel`); the
  hook existed and nothing called it, so a run that reached the prompt hung. The README now lists
  every capture option, not two thirds of them.
- **GNOME Software's Project Website button works before installing.** The window opened by
  double-clicking a downloaded `.deb` reads only the package's own fields, and the packages
  declared no homepage. They now name termina-project.dev (the deb's `Homepage`, the rpm's `URL`,
  the MSI's About link). That window still shows a generic icon and Unknown License for any
  downloaded package; the listing, with the icon, licence and release notes, is on Termina's page
  under Installed.
- **0.14.0 has release notes in Software.** Its page said "No details for this release".
- **Every window tells the system whether the theme is light or dark.** Only a terminal window
  with the menu bar in its title bar was told, and only its buttons; the rest — an ordinary
  terminal window, Settings, About, Keyboard Shortcuts, confirmation dialogs — reported the
  desktop's setting, which is what JavaFX picks a native frame's dark variant from on Windows and
  macOS. On Linux the native frame follows the desktop whatever the app says.
- **`termina --version`, `--help` and `--report` answer without a display.** The window toolkit was
  started before the command line was read, so where there is no display — over SSH, in a
  container, or when the display is the very problem `--report` is for — each ended in "Unable to
  open DISPLAY" and a stack trace, and a mistyped option did too, in place of its message. They
  now answer before the toolkit starts, and sooner everywhere. A launch that only hands its
  arguments to the Termina already running no longer starts the toolkit either.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-10-31

Signed and notarized macOS dmgs, signed Linux downloads, an AppImage and a tarball, a proper GNOME
Software listing, and Ctrl+click on the URLs in Markdown links. New downloads and new behaviour, so
the minor number moves.

### Added

- **Linux AppImage and tarball.** Each release carries a `.AppImage` and a `.tar.gz` for x64 and
  arm64 beside the deb and rpm, for distributions with neither package manager and for users
  without root.
- **The Linux downloads are signed.** Every one has an OpenPGP signature beside it (`.asc`), by the
  key attached to the release and committed as `packaging/linux/signing-key.asc`; the rpm and the
  deb are signed inside as well, for `rpm -K`, `dnf` and `debsig-verify`.

### Changed

- **The macOS app is signed and notarized.** Both dmgs (Apple Silicon and Intel) are now signed with
  a Developer ID certificate and notarized by Apple, so Termina opens on first launch with no
  Gatekeeper warning and no trip to System Settings → Privacy & Security, and the Homebrew cask no
  longer carries that caveat. The Windows MSI is still unsigned.

### Fixed

- **GNOME Software showed the deb as a bare package**: "termina", a generic icon, Unknown License
  and the one-line summary twice. Software ties a listing to its package by asking which package
  owns the metainfo file, and the deb's was copied in by its install script, so it belonged to none.
  The deb now owns its metainfo and an icon in the theme, the metainfo names its package, and the
  releases in it carry notes, so Software shows the description, the MIT licence and the icon.
- **Ctrl+click opens the URLs in Markdown links** (Cmd+click on macOS). A URL was recognised only
  at the start of a word, so `[docs](https://…)` read as a file path that did not exist and the
  click did nothing. A badge's `[![CI](…/badge.svg)](…/ci.yml)` is now two links.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-10-27

Everything from the [2026-10-27 review](docs/reference/review-2026-10-27.md): padding, a hollow cursor in
unfocused panes, `-T` for the first tab's title, Reopen for panes and windows, and Linux packages
that install on Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 again. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number
moves.

### Added

- **The right-click menu opens the command palette and the About window**, beside Settings, so
  neither needs the menu bar or a chord to reach.
- **Padding around the text.** Terminal → Display → Padding, 4 px by default, 0–32, applied live.
- **Reopen Closed Tab brings back a closed pane and a closed window**, not only a tab. A pane comes
  back as a tab of its own beside the one it left.
- **`-T title` / `--title`** names the first tab, as Debian's `x-terminal-emulator` expects.
- **Linux packages put `termina` on the path**, ship AppStream metainfo for the software centres,
  and declare `X-TerminalArgExec` for `xdg-terminal-exec`; the `.deb` registers Termina as an
  `x-terminal-emulator` alternative.

### Changed

- **The command palette opens with Ctrl+Shift+P** (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS). Alt+X was the shell's
  — Emacs's and zsh's M-x. A chord you stored yourself still wins.
- **On macOS, New Tab With Profile 1–9 is Cmd+Option+1–9.** Cmd+Shift+3, 4 and 5 are the system's
  screenshot keys, so three of them never reached Termina.
- **An unfocused pane or window draws a hollow cursor**, so the pane that takes your keys is the
  one with the solid block. A bar or underline cursor is dimmed instead.
- **`settings.properties` takes backslashes literally and is UTF-8**, so a Windows path can be typed
  as it is. Files written by earlier versions read the same.
- **Shells no longer inherit the launching terminal's identity** — `TMUX`, kitty's, WezTerm's,
  iTerm2's and Windows Terminal's variables, `COLUMNS`/`LINES`, `TERMINFO` — and
  `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION` is Termina's own.
- **Theme import runs in the background**, and names that would share a file get files of their own.
- **Search keeps the newest 1,000 matches** rather than the oldest, reads the scrollback in chunks
  from the bottom up, and waits for typing to pause.

### Fixed

- **Colours written with colons printed the colons.** `ESC[38:2::255:0:0m`, the form newer
  programs use for true colour, showed `:::::` before the text and dropped the colour; the palette
  form `38:5:n` and underline styles (`4:3`, Neovim's curly underline) did the same. They are now
  read like their semicolon forms. Underline styles all draw as the one underline, and an underline
  colour is ignored.
- **Kitty graphics and other application strings printed as text.** An image sent with the kitty
  graphics protocol appeared as a line of base64; APC, SOS and PM strings are now discarded, as
  xterm does.
- **Full screen kept the title bar** when the menu bar is in the title bar: the title and the
  window buttons stayed at the top of the screen. Full screen now has no title bar; the menus, if
  shown, stay as an ordinary row.

Installing:

- **The `.deb` installs on Debian 12 and Ubuntu 22.04 again.** It depended on `libasound2t64`,
  which exists only on Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04 — for sound Termina never plays.
- **The Linux packages declare what JavaFX needs** (GTK 3, GL, fontconfig, FreeType and the rest),
  so a minimal system installs them rather than failing at start.
- **LICENSE and a complete NOTICE ship in every installed copy**; the `.deb`'s copyright file said
  "License: Unknown".
- **macOS bundles are re-signed after the AOT cache is added**, every build. From 1.0.0 the version
  fix-up would have skipped it and shipped a broken signature.
- **Pre-release tags (`v0.13.0-rc1`) build**, and releases run the tests and CI's artefact checks
  before publishing. CI's own check that the packaged shell ran a command passed on the prompt alone.

Starting and settings:

- **A malformed `\u` in a hand-edited settings file stopped the app opening.** A file that cannot
  be read now opens on defaults and is kept as `settings.properties.bad-<time>`.
- **Two Termina processes no longer overwrite each other's settings.**
- **Deleting a profile left its theme, default and hidden state to the next profile created**, and
  adding one while a profile was hidden selected the hidden one.
- **The system shell was listed twice** when `$SHELL` and `/etc/shells` spelled it differently.
- **When the shell cannot start at all, the window stays open and says why**, instead of the app
  quitting with the reason only in the log.
- **Closing a full-screen window made the next launch open screen-sized.**
- **On Windows with no WSL distributions**, `wsl.exe`'s explanation became menu entries.
  Distributions are read from the registry first.

The terminal:

- **The cursor drifted a cell right for each emoji or Nerd Font Material icon on its line.**
- **Text after a combining mark, a zero-width joiner or a variation selector (⚠️) shifted a cell
  left.**
- **A malformed OSC or keyboard-mode sequence could close the pane** — on Windows, an OSC 7 path
  the system could not parse.
- **Link hover looked at the filesystem while holding the terminal**, once per mouse move for a
  declared link; a slow mount froze the window. Each target is now checked once, outside the lock,
  and the underline moves with its text as output scrolls.
- **Wheel scrolling or drag-selecting while output streamed could jump.**
- **A mouse-reporting program was sent a release for a press it never saw.**

Windows, tabs and keys:

- **Chords typed into the command palette or the find bar reached the menus behind them** —
  Ctrl+Shift+W in the palette closed the tab.
- **Many tabs in a narrow window**: the first was clipped, the selected tab's name hidden, and the
  overflow arrow sat on its close button. Tabs shrink further and the selected one stays whole.
- **A reordered tab could no longer be dragged, renamed by double-click or dropped onto.**
- **Close Other Tabs or Close Tabs to the Right, then Reopen, restored them out of order.**
- **A tab's right-click menu could lose the keyboard**; closing it returns it to the terminal.
- **The next character typed after a dialog answered with the mouse was dropped.**
- **Closed windows stayed in memory until the app quit.**
- **The shortcut reference listed nine profile shortcuts with one profile.**

Sync and updates:

- **A sync retried after another computer pushed first, or after a failed push, sent back the
  older binding it had just received**, overwriting the newer one.
- **Sync reported success without sending anything** when a global git ignore file or the
  repository's `.gitignore` matched the bindings.
- **A sync that hit an unexpected error stayed on "Syncing…" until restart.** A bindings file over
  1 MiB in the repository is refused.
- **A server that stopped partway through an answer left the update check hanging**, Check for
  Updates included. The whole request now ends within 30 seconds.

Translations:

- **French and Italian showed doubled apostrophes** in five places, and theme import errors,
  "(imported)", "Imported" and "Command Prompt" were English in every language.
- **Settings named fixed chords** — "Ctrl/Cmd+T" for the default profile, "+Shift+1 through 9" for
  profiles — where the real ones differ by platform and can be changed. They name the live ones.
- **Importing a theme file with a byte-order mark failed.**
- **The Settings search box looked empty**: its prompt disappeared while focused.

### Security

- **A `file:` link to another machine, or any UNC path, is never opened or looked up.** One was
  handed to the system's URL opener (on Windows, an SMB fetch that sends the user's credentials
  hash), and hovering over one made a network connection.
- **A crafted `.terminal` theme can no longer hang or crash the app** — shared references in its
  binary property list were expanded once per path, and a deep chain overflowed the stack.
- **Release workflows run with read-only tokens except where they publish**, the JReleaser action
  is pinned to a commit, and release artefacts carry build-provenance attestations.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-10-25

The sync repository can be created on GitHub from Settings, and the shortcut reference names what a
middle-click pastes on Linux. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number moves.

### Added

- **Create the sync repository from Settings.** Where the GitHub CLI is installed and signed in,
  Settings → Sync has Create on GitHub… beside Connect: it asks for a name (`termina-sync`), makes a
  private repository with `gh repo create`, and connects to it — over SSH if that is the protocol
  `gh` is set to, HTTPS otherwise. As in Editora.

### Fixed

- **The shortcut reference said a middle-click pastes the clipboard** on Linux, where it pastes the
  PRIMARY selection. It says "Paste the selection" there now.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-10-25

Split panes, scrollback search, shell integration and shortcuts that can all be changed. Four
requests programs make of a terminal — a declared link, the clipboard, the directory, a
notification — are honoured rather than dropped, typing over a slow SSH link is predicted, programs
can ask for the kitty keyboard protocol, and an idle terminal lets the machine idle. Selection
autoscrolls, makes blocks and survives typing; panes maximize, move and reopen as they were; themes
can be imported from six other terminals' formats; and a profile can have its own font and theme.

### Added

- **Selection does more.** Dragging past the top or bottom edge scrolls and keeps selecting, faster
  the further out, with the pointer held still. Alt+drag (Option on macOS, Ctrl+Alt where the window
  manager takes Alt) selects a block, copied a row per line. Copy on select is a setting on
  Terminal → Input. On Linux a selection is the PRIMARY selection and a middle-click pastes it,
  through `wl-paste`/`wl-copy` or `xclip`/`xsel`.
- **Maximize, move and drag panes.** Window → Maximize Pane (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter`) shows the
  active pane alone, with the others still running. Move Pane to New Tab, palette rows to move it
  into any other tab, and Cmd+Option+Shift-drag (Ctrl+Alt+Shift elsewhere) onto a tab or the strip.
  Reopen Closed Tab brings a split tab back with every pane, arranged as it was.
- **Desktop notifications (OSC 9, OSC 777).** A program's notification marks its tab with a dot that
  outranks the bell's, and reaches the desktop unless you are looking at that pane: `notify-send`
  or the session bus on Linux, `osascript` on macOS, a toast on Windows. Terminal → Display turns the
  desktop half off.
- **Import a theme.** Settings → Appearance → Import… reads iTerm2 `.itermcolors`, Terminal
  `.terminal`, Windows Terminal schemes or `settings.json`, and Ghostty, kitty and Alacritty themes,
  colours taken exactly as written. Remove deletes one again.
- **A profile's own font, size and theme**, on Settings → Profiles, for any profile including the
  system shell. They follow the pane through splits, duplicates, moves and reopening.
- **Windows tabs know their directory without OSC 7.** It is read out of the shell process. A
  directory the shell reports still wins there, since a WSL tab's process is `wsl.exe`.

- **The kitty keyboard protocol.** A program that asks — Neovim, Vim, Helix, fish and nushell do —
  gets unambiguous keys: Escape on its own, Ctrl+I apart from Tab, Shift+Enter as a key of its own,
  and with the further flags repeats and releases, the shifted key, every key including the
  modifiers, and the text each types. Each screen keeps its own mode, a query is answered, and
  `reset` clears it. Nothing changes for a program that does not ask.

- **Split panes.** Window → Split Right and Split Down (`Cmd+D`/`Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS,
  `Ctrl+Shift+E`/`Ctrl+Shift+O` elsewhere) open another shell beside or below the one you are in,
  same shell, same directory. `Cmd+Option+arrows` (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+arrows`) or a click moves between
  them, and the pane being typed in is outlined. Close Tab's chord closes the active pane of a split
  tab, and the menu says "Close Pane" while it does; a shell that exits closes its own pane. The tab
  is titled after the active pane.
- **Search the scrollback.** Edit → Find… (`Cmd+F`/`Ctrl+Shift+F`) opens a find bar in the pane:
  every match highlighted as you type, the current one outlined, Enter stepping up to older output
  and Shift+Enter down. Smart case, an optional regular expression, and a word that wrapped at the
  edge is still found. Find Next and Find Previous work from anywhere (`Cmd+G`/`Cmd+Shift+G`,
  `Ctrl+Shift+G`/`Ctrl+Shift+H`), and a short selection becomes the query.
- **Shell integration (OSC 133).** A shell that marks its prompts gets Edit → Previous Prompt and
  Next Prompt (`Cmd+Up`/`Cmd+Down`, `Ctrl+Shift+Up`/`Down`), Select Last Output, and a red bar beside
  the prompt of a command that failed. The README has the lines to add to bash and zsh. The marks
  stay on their prompts through a resize.
- **Links a program declares (OSC 8)** are clickable — `ls --hyperlink`, compilers, `gh`. Hovering
  one shows where it really goes at the bottom of the pane, and only the schemes a link in the text
  may use are accepted, so a `javascript:` target is not a link.
- **Programs can copy to the clipboard (OSC 52)**, which is how vim and tmux copy over SSH. Never
  read it. Terminal → Input turns it off.
- **On Windows, a shell that reports its directory (OSC 7)** gives its tab a directory: new tabs
  open there and relative paths become links. Only a directory on this machine that exists.
- **Type-ahead over slow SSH.** While `ssh` runs and the far end echoes slower than 100 ms, typed
  characters appear at once, dimmed and underlined until confirmed. JediTerm's predictor decides
  when; a local shell is never predicted. Terminal → Input turns it off.

- **Every shortcut can be changed.** Settings has a Keyboard page listing each command under its
  menu: click a shortcut and press the new one. A shortcut another command has moves on a second
  press, Backspace removes one, and Reset or Reset All Shortcuts puts them back. Commands with no
  shortcut of their own, such as Rename Tab, can be given one. The menus, the palette, the shortcut
  reference and the tab strip's tooltips follow the change at once. The command palette's shortcut,
  which had a row of its own on the Terminal page, is now one of these and keeps its stored value.
- **Key bindings sync between computers.** Settings → Sync connects Termina to a private Git
  repository you own; the shortcuts you change are pushed there and picked up by every other
  connected computer — after startup, half a minute after a change, every 15 minutes while a window
  is in front, or on Sync Now. Macs share one list and Windows and Linux another, since a chord means
  a different key on each. A shortcut changed on two computers keeps the version of the one that
  syncs; bindings a sync replaces are copied to `sync/backups` first, and a sync that would remove
  most of them stops and asks. Git signs in with your credential helper or SSH key and an automatic
  sync never prompts; a URL with a password or token in it is refused. With several GitHub CLI
  accounts (`gh auth switch`), sync finds the one that can read an `https://` repository, remembers
  it, and keeps signing in as it whichever account is active; the Sync page names it. File → Sync
  Settings Now (also in the palette) syncs from anywhere and says how it went. A settings folder
  inside a dotfiles repository that does not ignore `sync/` is refused rather than nested.
- **Icons draw correctly without a Nerd Font installed.** Symbols Nerd Font Mono 3.5.1 is bundled
  with the other faces and used for private-use code points when no Nerd Font build of the
  terminal's own face is installed. Its icons are drawn a cell and a half wide, the size the Nerd
  Font builds draw theirs, and Powerline separators still span the line so a prompt's segments
  meet. It has no letters, so it is kept out of the font picker.

### Changed

- **A keystroke no longer clears the selection.** It goes when the text under it changes.
- **Middle-click pastes PRIMARY on Linux** where a tool to read it is installed, rather than the
  clipboard.

- **An idle terminal lets the machine idle.** Each tab used to keep a repaint timer running from
  open to close, which held JavaFX at 60 frames a second with nothing to draw. The timer now runs
  only while there is something to paint. With one tab sitting at a prompt, CPU use went from
  2–3% of a core to 0.8%.
- **Background tabs stop painting.** A tab that is not selected keeps its output and paints it
  when you switch to it, instead of drawing every frame into a canvas nobody can see. A build
  running in another tab no longer competes with the one you are typing in. Activity and bell
  marks on the tab still update.
- **Knowing what a tab is running costs microseconds.** The title and the close prompt learn a
  shell's running program by asking the OS for that process's children directly, instead of
  reading the whole process table every 750 ms per tab. That was 3.4 ms a call on a desktop with
  610 processes, about a tenth of a core at twenty tabs.
- **The first window paints sooner.** Opening a tab checks only the font it is going to use.
  Measuring every installed font, about 100 ms on a Linux desktop, now happens only when the font
  picker in Settings needs the list.
- **Less work per frame and per setting.** Truecolour cells reuse their colours rather than
  allocating new ones every frame. A settings change rebuilds fonts only if the family or size
  changed, and a burst of window-title updates from a program is applied once.

### Fixed

- **Closing one window of several left its shells running** until the app quit, with their threads
  and directory polls. A window's tabs are now disposed however it closes.
- **A drag held while output scrolled extended from the wrong text**: the anchor did not move with
  its line as the selection did.

- **A stray `¯` or `ÿ` before some icons in `eza` and `ls` listings.** With no Nerd Font face
  chosen, JavaFX drew private-use icons in the first installed font that claimed the code point,
  and some ordinary fonts do: Arial maps the icon eza uses for a symlinked file. Icons are now
  drawn in an installed Nerd Font, or the bundled one.
- **Drag-selecting while output arrived could read a line mid-write.** The mouse handlers read the
  screen without the lock the emulator writes under. They now take it.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-10-23

An icon beside each page in the settings sidebar. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number
moves.

### Added

- **The settings sidebar has icons.** Appearance has a palette, Terminal a prompt window, Profiles
  stacked layers and Advanced sliders — Material glyphs, the same family as the context menu's.
  They are muted at rest and take the accent colour when their page is selected, and each sits in
  a box of fixed width so the labels beside them line up.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-10-21

The command palette is now Editora's: the same card, the same matcher and ranking, and Emacs keys
to drive it. It opens on Alt+X instead of Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+P, and the chord is a setting. The
default chord changed, so the minor number moves.

### Changed

- **The command palette is Editora's.** Same card: the query row led by a chip naming the chord
  that opened it, eight rows with the matched characters emboldened, a line describing the
  highlighted command, and a legend of the keys. Same matcher, so the two palettes rank alike —
  "tab close" finds Close Tab with the words in either order, and "file new" reaches New Tab
  through the menu it lives in. Ties go to the shorter, then the alphabetical label, so equal rows
  stop shuffling under the cursor between keystrokes. A command that cannot run right now (Reopen
  Closed Tab with nothing to reopen) is listed greyed with the reason as its tooltip instead of
  dropped, and the cursor steps over it. A click on a row runs it.
- **It opens on Alt+X**, Emacs's M-x and the chord Editora's palette answers to, instead of
  Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+P. The chord is a setting (Terminal → Keyboard): click the field and press another
  one. A bare key is refused because the shell owns it, and so is a chord another command already
  has, because the first binding on a chord is the only one that runs. A hand-edited line that does
  not parse, or names a taken chord, falls back to Alt+X rather than leaving the palette with no
  way in.
- **Emacs keys in the palette.** Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P move, Ctrl+V and Alt+V page, Alt+< and Alt+>
  jump to the ends, Ctrl+G cancels — token for token Editora's Emacs keymap — and the query field
  takes Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+F, Ctrl+B, Alt+F, Alt+B, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+K, Alt+D, Ctrl+W, Alt+W, Ctrl+Y
  and Ctrl+/. The legend under the list names them in the platform's notation, the same one the
  menus use.

### Fixed

- **The chord that opens the palette no longer leaks its typed character:** on macOS Option+X also
  composes "≈", which landed in the query field the chord had just focused.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-21

The fixes from the 2026-10-20 review, and the features that fell out of it: tabs can be renamed,
reopened and duplicated and say when something happened in them, there is a searchable list of
every keyboard shortcut, a paste with a line break asks first, and the menu bar can share a row
with the title bar. Moved to JavaFX 27. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number moves.

### Added

- **The menu bar can share a row with the title bar.** Appearance → Window → "Put the menu bar in
  the title bar" merges the two: menus at the left, the window title in the middle, the window
  buttons at the right, and the terminal gains the row the native title bar took. Off by default.
  It applies to windows opened after the change, because a window's style is fixed when it is
  first shown, and the row says so. Not offered on macOS, where the menus are in the screen menu
  bar and there is nothing in the window to merge.

- **A paste with a line break asks first.** At a prompt every line of a paste runs the moment it
  lands, which is how a copied snippet with a stray newline becomes an executed command. The prompt
  shows the text that will be sent, with Paste as the default button; Terminal → Input turns it
  off. Pasted text is also sanitised: escape and other control characters are stripped before a
  (bracketed) paste, so clipboard contents can no longer end the bracket early and run as typing.
- **Keyboard scrollback and the Linux paste reflexes.** Shift+PageUp, Shift+PageDown, Shift+Home
  and Shift+End move through the scrollback (and reach the program as before on the alternate
  screen); Shift+Insert pastes, Ctrl+Insert copies, and middle-click pastes the clipboard — JavaFX
  has no access to the X11 primary selection, so it is the clipboard rather than the selection.
- **Tabs are named after the running program** — `vim`, `ssh`, `npm` — when the shell has not set
  a title, and only then after the directory. Three tabs in `~` were three tabs called `~`.
- **Advanced → Updates** carries the switch for the startup update check, which existed only as a
  key in the file. About says when the last check ran.
- **Inline validation** under the shell field and a profile's command and starting directory:
  "Not found", "Not executable", "Not a directory", as you type. A shell path that names nothing
  was silently replaced by `$SHELL`, and the row never said so.
- **Rename, reopen and duplicate a tab.** Double-click a tab (or use its menu, the Window menu or
  the palette) to give it a name; the name outranks the shell's title and the program, and an
  empty name brings the automatic title back. **Reopen Closed Tab** (`Cmd+Z` on macOS,
  `Ctrl+Shift+Z` elsewhere; File menu) brings back the last tab closed on purpose — the same shell
  or profile, the directory it was in when it closed, its name, and its old place in the strip —
  not its scrollback, since the process is gone. The last ten are kept; a shell that exited by
  itself is not among them. **Duplicate Tab** opens a second tab like this one, where it is now,
  right beside it.
- **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** (`Cmd+/` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+/` elsewhere) lists every chord
  the window answers to, searchable, generated from the menus and the binding table rather than
  typed — so it cannot advertise a chord the filter does not implement — plus the keys the terminal
  handles by itself: Shift+PageUp and friends, Shift+Insert, Ctrl+Insert, middle-click, the link
  modifier, Shift+drag and double-click to rename.
- **A background tab says when something happened in it.** A dot after the title: accent for
  output that arrived after two quiet seconds — a build finishing, a prompt returning — and the
  warning colour for a bell. Selecting the tab clears it. A tab that streams continuously is marked
  once and left alone; a new tab's own first prompt does not count.
- **The window's last position is remembered** along with its size, and pulled back onto a screen
  that still exists.

### Changed

- **The palette lists the tabs that exist, by title**, with the chord that reaches each, instead of
  nine numbered "Go to Tab" rows of which most were dead. Its menu-bar row says "Show" or "Hide"
  according to the current state.

- **`sh` and `dash` are no longer offered as shell profiles**, and shells that are symlinks to
  the same binary are listed once. Nobody opens a tab as `dash`.
- **The cursor's DECSCUSR 0 ("default") still arrives from JediTerm as a blinking block,
  indistinguishable from an explicit 1, so a program that resets to "default" rather than to "no
  shape" still leaves a block.** Said here because the fix above covers the other case.

- **Moved to JavaFX 27.** Its extended stage style (`StageStyle.EXTENDED` and `HeaderBar`), a preview
  feature in 25 and 26, is final there and is what the title-bar option is built on.
- **`scripts/dev-run.sh` now clears `target/deps` before refilling it, so a dependency bump cannot
  leave the old jar beside the new one with the old one winning.**
- **Dependencies brought up to date:** JediTerm 3.76 (mouse-scroll direction fix, faster double-width
  checks), pty4j 0.14.0 (`Cleaner` instead of `finalize`, a fix for `breakRead` waking the wrong
  PTY after a close, retries when opening the PTY master, ConPTY 1.24), Kotlin stdlib 2.4.21, slf4j
  2.0.20, Jackson 2.22.4 and JUnit 6.1. Build plugins likewise: Spotless 3.10.4 with
  palantir-java-format 2.102.0 (one reflow), JaCoCo 0.8.15, ModiTect 1.3.0, jpackage-maven-plugin
  1.8.0, the compiler, surefire, dependency and exec plugins, and Maven 3.9.16 in the wrapper.
  antrun stays at 3.1.0, because 3.2.0 warns about every exported property.

### Fixed

- **Escape no longer leaves full screen.** JavaFX's default full-screen exit key is Escape,
  handled before the terminal sees it, and it painted a "Press ESC to exit full screen" banner over
  the shell — so the first Escape in vim dropped the window out of full screen instead of leaving
  insert mode. F11 (Ctrl+Cmd+F on macOS) is now the only way in and out. Verified by pressing the
  key through the operating system.
- **Close Window has a chord that works.** Off macOS it was `Ctrl+Shift+W`, the same chord as
  Close Tab, which the key filter reached first; the File menu and the palette advertised a binding
  that did nothing. It is now `Ctrl+Shift+Q`, GNOME Terminal's and Konsole's. macOS keeps
  `Cmd+Shift+W`. Registering two bindings on one chord now fails loudly, and the chord table is
  tested for duplicates on both platform branches.
- **A default profile that cannot start no longer closes the window.** The failed tab was removed
  before the error was shown; an empty window closes itself, the last window closing quits, and the
  dialog then opened on a dead owner — leaving nobody a window to fix the profile from. The error
  now names the command that failed, the default shell opens in its place when the window would
  otherwise be empty, and the dialog is an explanation rather than a gate.
- **The tab strip's overflow is drawn, not hidden.** With more tabs than fit, JavaFX's overflow
  control and the last tab's close button were painted under the floating `+`; the strip now keeps
  its right end clear and the controls there are opaque, so a scrolled tab ends where they begin.
- **Zoom In's menu says `Ctrl+=`**, the key every common layout actually produces, instead of
  `Ctrl++`. A real `+` key and the keypad's still zoom.

- **A selection and a scrolled-back view stay on their text as output arrives**, including once
  the scrollback is full. The shift was driven from JediTerm's history-buffer listener, which (in
  3.76) fires only when history is cleared or the buffer resized — never for an ordinary newline —
  so a selection made while a build ran came to highlight different text from what copying it
  produced, and reading a log while it grew slid it along under the pointer. Driven from the model
  listener now, with the resize path left to JediTerm, which shifts the selection itself; a
  regression test writes into a real buffer and checks the selected text is unchanged.
- **A drag highlights exactly what it copies.** Highlighting treated the end cell as inclusive and
  copying as exclusive, so dragging to the last letter of a word lost it. One convention now: the
  cell under the pointer is included once the pointer passes its middle, and a backward drag keeps
  the pressed cell.
- **No phantom selections inside mouse-aware programs.** A click reported to the program left the
  previous plain click's anchor behind, and a later drag in a press-only mode selected from it.
- **A program that resets the terminal gives the cursor back its configured shape.** The reset
  arrived as "no shape" and was ignored, so vim's block outlived vim.
- **Wheel and trackpad scrolling move by distance**, not three lines per event — trackpads send
  many small events, so scrollback flew past.
- **Reset to Defaults asks first, and keeps your profiles**, the default-profile choice and hidden
  profiles. It cleared the whole file, profiles included, on one click.
- **The settings file is written atomically** — to a sibling and moved into place — so a crash or
  power loss mid-write cannot leave it empty. A save that fails is shown in red on the Settings
  file row instead of being logged and forgotten.
- **The Settings window follows changes made elsewhere while it is open** — a theme from the
  palette, the menu bar from its chord, zoom. A stale checkbox used to need two clicks, the first
  of which did nothing.
- **Settings and About no longer close with the window that opened them.** They were owned by the
  first window to open them, for life.
- **Update-check errors are readable** — "You appear to be offline", "GitHub refused the request"
  — rather than a Java class name, and after the release page has been opened the Help item goes
  back to "Check for Updates…" instead of advertising the same version until restart.
- **Font size and scrollback accept "13px"-style input** instead of throwing on the FX thread.
- **A second running instance no longer wipes the first one's session log.**
- **Ctrl+Alt+letter sends Meta plus the control byte** (readline's `C-M-f`), Ctrl+3 through Ctrl+8
  send xterm's control bytes, and the keypad arrows work with NumLock off. Programs that ask for
  any-motion mouse reporting (mode 1003) now receive pointer motion.
- **Rendering.** The cursor is drawn on the last column when a line is exactly full; a block
  cursor shows the glyph beneath it in the cell's own font and colours; rows are at least as tall
  as the font's metrics ask, so descenders are no longer overpainted by a coloured row below; box
  drawing, block and braille characters stay on the batched fast path instead of one draw call per
  glyph; a window resize reflows the terminal once the size settles rather than on every pixel;
  a thousand bells are one flash; and a selection is cleared when a full-screen program starts or
  exits rather than drawn over it.
- **Closing a tab no longer pauses the window for up to half a second** waiting for its threads.
- **Child shells get `LANG=C.UTF-8`** rather than `en_US.UTF-8` when no locale is set — the
  latter is often not generated on minimal systems and bash said so at every prompt — and
  `LC_ALL`/`LC_CTYPE` are respected. "Automatic" interface language no longer narrows the JVM's
  locale to a bare language, which changed dates and numbers in dialogs.
- **New windows cascade from the window the action came from** and stay on its screen.
- **On Windows, Ctrl+click opens files through the shell handler** rather than `cmd /c start`, so
  `&`, `^` and `%` in a name are not interpreted. (Still unrun on Windows.)
- **Settings search prefers a match in a row's title and opens that row's page; the profiles note
  names the platform's own chord; the shell field's prompt is translated; row titles and
  checkboxes are labelled for screen readers; arrow keys in the settings sidebar skip the group
  headers; Escape closes Settings, About and the Debug Log.** `NaN` in a hand-edited settings file
  is treated as absent rather than handed to the font.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-30

Fixes for keyboard input, shell-profile startup, and commands that could hang discovery or the
interface. No new features, so the patch number moves.

### Changed

- **Added regressions for AltGr input, deferred profile startup, asynchronous link-command resolution,
  and subprocess timeouts and output limits.**
- **Made the working-directory integration test retry its harmless `cd` command until shell startup
  accepts input.**
- **Corrected Linux installer validation to select a regular desktop-entry file rather than the
  bundled JDK's `java.desktop` directory.**
- **Updated release-page installation instructions for the native installers and published checksum
  filename.**

### Fixed

- **Opening a file link no longer blocks the interface.** Resolving the configured editor command
  can start a login shell to read its PATH; that work now runs on the launcher worker.
- **AltGr characters reach the shell.** Ctrl+Alt combinations used to compose characters such as
  `@` are no longer sent as control chords or discarded by the typed-character handler.
- **Startup respects the selected shell profile.** When the saved default needs discovery, the
  first session waits for the result instead of opening the system shell prematurely. Command-line
  commands still launch immediately, and `-d` still takes precedence over a profile's directory.
- **Login-shell PATH and WSL discovery enforce their five-second deadlines.** A command that keeps
  stdout open can no longer bypass the timeout. Timed-out processes are terminated.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-12

A tab can be opened as any shell the machine has, rather than only as the one shell a setting could
name. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number moves.

**Known gaps.** Unchanged from 0.6.2, except that the first entry below is new and the Windows one has grown teeth.

- **The Windows half of shell profiles has not run on Windows.** Every branch of discovery is driven
  in tests with the filesystem and `wsl.exe` probes replaced, and CI builds and packages Windows on
  every commit — but "PowerShell 7 is installed at that path" and "`wsl --list` answers in that
  shape" are claims about a machine, not about code, and nothing in a test can check them.
  `-Dtermina.captureProfiles=true` prints every entry a machine found and the command it runs; that
  is the check. The macOS and Linux halves are exercised the same way and the macOS one is
  device-tested.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.
- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7
  would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **Shell profiles.** A terminal on Windows is not one program — Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell,
  PowerShell 7 and every installed WSL distribution are separate shells with separate command lines,
  and a single "path to your shell" setting can only ever name one of them. A profile is a name, a
  command and optionally a directory, and a window now offers all of them: a chevron beside the `+`
  drops the list, **File ▸ New Tab With** carries the same entries, the command palette lists them by
  name, and `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+1` through `9` open the first nine.

  What is on the list is **found, not configured**. On Windows that is both PowerShells (7 first — it
  is the one somebody installed on purpose), Command Prompt, Git Bash, and each WSL distribution, with
  Docker Desktop's and Rancher's internal pseudo-distributions left out. On macOS and Linux it is the
  shells named in `/etc/shells` and on the path — zsh, bash, fish, nushell and the rest — one entry
  per shell rather than one per binary, and each started with the login flag it actually understands
  rather than a blanket `-l`. Nothing found is written down: uninstall a shell and it leaves the menu
  rather than becoming an entry that fails to start.

  Your own shell is always first and can never be hidden, so a machine where nothing is found offers
  exactly what it did before this existed. Anything else can be hidden, and you can add profiles of
  your own — `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu`, a shell on a server, a directory you keep coming back to — in
  **Settings ▸ Profiles** or by hand in `settings.properties`, which is where the whole list lives.

- **Marks in the profile menu.** Each entry carries its shell's or distribution's own glyph, so the
  list reads as a set of shells rather than a column of words — recognising the Ubuntu circle is
  faster than reading "Ubuntu (WSL)". The marks are Simple Icons, CC0 (see NOTICE). Microsoft's are
  not among them: PowerShell, Windows and Windows Terminal have been withdrawn from that collection
  over trademark, so Command Prompt and both PowerShells carry a generic prompt drawn for Termina
  rather than a lookalike.

- **`-Dtermina.captureProfiles=true`** opens the profile dropdown and reports what is in it. The list
  is assembled from what a machine has, so on Windows this is the only way to see the entries the
  feature exists for.

### Changed

- **The chevron beside the `+` is a stroked glyph rather than a filled triangle.** Everything else on
  the tab strip — the `+`, every close button — is a thin outline, and a solid ▼ among them read as
  the heaviest thing in the row, which is backwards for the subordinate half of a pair.

- **A command given with `-e` still replaces the shell, and `-d` still wins over a profile's own
  starting directory.** One is an instruction for this launch; the other is a standing preference.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-11

Interface fixes and polish. No new behaviour, so the patch number moves.

**Known gaps.** Unchanged from 0.6.1.

- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.
- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7
  would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Changed

- **The zoom row separates full screen from the zoom controls.** The minus, the percentage and the plus
  are one control — a value with a decrement and an increment — while full screen is a different action
  that happens to share the row, and the only button there that closes the menu. It now sits a little
  apart instead of flush against the plus. The row does not get wider: the gap comes out of the space
  between the label and the controls.

- **"Colour theme" is now "Color theme."** The only British spelling in the interface. Its Settings
  search still matches both, so typing either word finds the row.

### Fixed

- **Tabs can be dragged to reorder them.** They always could, in principle: the gesture, the drop-side
  detection and the accent edge showing where the tab would land have been there since tabs were. It was
  installed on the title *label*, though, and a tab is a great deal wider than its name — measured on a
  three-tab window, 286 pixels of tab and 13 of label. Unless you caught the two characters of text,
  nothing happened, which from the outside is a terminal that cannot reorder tabs. The gesture now covers
  the whole tab, and what follows the pointer is the tab rather than its text.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-11

Two fixes to the clickable links 0.6.0 introduced, and a set of dependency bumps. No new behaviour, so
the patch number moves rather than the minor.

**Known gaps.** Unchanged from 0.6.0.

- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.

  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland

- **Routine dependency bumps:** pty4j 0.13.10 → 0.13.12, JNA 5.17.0 → 5.19.1, Jackson 2.22.1, JUnit 5.14.4.
  All patch or minor.

  Checked against a packaged build rather than the suite alone, because pty4j ships the native libraries
  for every platform and JNA is how they are found — and those survive packaging by an accident of JPMS
  rather than by design (see the note in the README). The built app image starts a real shell and runs a
  command in it.

### Fixed

- **"Could not run Editora" said nothing about what to do.** Typing an application's name into
  *Open files with* is the obvious thing to try, and on macOS there is usually no command by that
  name — the program lives inside the bundle. The message now distinguishes a command that names
  nothing on this machine from one that would not start, and says what a working value looks like.

- **A configured command is now found the way the user's shell would find it.** An application
  launched from Finder or a desktop entry inherits a stripped `PATH` — no Homebrew, no
  `~/.local/bin`, nothing a version manager added — so a command that runs perfectly in a terminal
  was simply not there from a click. The PATH is taken from a login shell, asked once and only when
  a bare command actually has to be resolved.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-10

The minor number moves for the clickable links; the Meta fix goes with it, and it is the one to read
first if any keyboard chord has ever behaved oddly for you.

**Known gaps.** Unchanged from 0.5.1, plus the first entry below.

- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.
- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7
  would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **Clickable links.** Cmd-click on macOS, Ctrl-click elsewhere, opens what is under the pointer:
  URLs go to the browser, and **paths go to the file** — including a `Foo.java:42:7` out of a stack
  trace or a compiler error. Hold the modifier and a link underlines itself and the pointer becomes
  a hand, so the gesture announces itself; the right-click menu carries **Open Link** and **Copy
  Link Address** for anyone who never finds it. A URL that wraps at the right edge is one link, not
  two.

  A path is only a link when it names a file that **exists**, resolved against that tab's own shell
  directory — which is what makes it usable rather than a screen full of underlined words, since no
  pattern can tell a filename from an ordinary word but the filesystem can. Only `http`, `https`,
  `ftp`, `ftps`, `file` and `mailto` are ever opened as URLs: terminal output is untrusted text, and
  a `javascript:` or an `app://` handler would be a click away from running something.

  Files open in whatever the desktop opens them with. **Settings ▸ Terminal ▸ Links** takes a
  command instead — `editora {file}:{line}` — which is the only way the line number survives, since
  `open` and `xdg-open` take a file and nothing else.

- **Hovering a tab shows its directory**, in full, with the home directory abbreviated as a shell
  writes it. The tab itself is a hundred-odd pixels and JavaFX ellipsises from the end, so it can
  only carry a name; the hover is where the path fits. It keeps showing the directory even when a
  program has set the tab's title — a tab reading `vim` has already said what is running, and where
  it is running has nowhere else to appear. Nothing is shown on Windows, which cannot yet report a
  shell's directory at all.

### Fixed

- **`M-f` and every other Meta chord typed garbage instead of running its command.** On macOS Option
  is a compose key — Option+F is `ƒ` — and the escape was being prefixed to *that*, so `M-f` went out
  as `1b c6 92`. A shell reads the escape as the meta prefix, takes the `c6` with it, and is left
  holding a lone UTF-8 continuation byte, which it renders as an unprintable box wherever the cursor
  was. So the whole readline word-movement and word-killing set — `M-f`, `M-b`, `M-d`, `M-u`, `M-l`
  and the rest — inserted a stray character instead of doing anything.

  Meta is now encoded from the key press, where the key is still the key, rather than from the typed
  event, which by then reports whatever the OS composed. Alt with Ctrl is left alone, because that
  combination is AltGr on Windows and Linux and composing is exactly what it is for.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-10

Two fixes, no new behaviour, so the patch number moves rather than the minor.

**Known gaps.** Unchanged from 0.5.0, less the macOS menus above.

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting. Handling OSC 7 would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not
  implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Fixed

- **macOS had no menus at all.** Not in the screen menu bar and not in the window: File, Edit, View,
  Window and Help were unreachable, leaving only the chords, the command palette and the right-click
  menu. JavaFX refuses `useSystemMenuBar` for the whole bar when any menu holds a custom item —
  AppKit draws those menus and cannot render a JavaFX node — and the zoom row is one, so the menus
  fell back into the window, where macOS collapses the bar to nothing on the assumption that the
  screen has them. The View menu now shows Zoom In, Zoom Out, Actual Size and Full Screen as
  ordinary items on macOS, which is what the platform can draw, and keeps the row everywhere else
  and in the right-click menu on every platform. Should a custom item reach the bar again, the
  in-window bar is no longer collapsed, so the cost is a Mac's screen menus rather than all of them.

- **The settings pages ran into the scrollbar.** Every control on the right — the combos, the
  checkboxes, the opacity readout — ended flush against it, and the preview's border appeared to
  pass underneath. The page now keeps the same margin from the scrollbar that it keeps from the
  sidebar, whether or not it is long enough to scroll.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-08

**Known gaps:**

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting. Handling OSC 7 would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not
  implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **A tooltip on each tab's close button**, naming the action and its chord, as the new-tab button
  already did.

### Fixed

- **Full screen from the zoom row looked like it did nothing.** The window went full screen, but the
  menu stayed open on top of it — and the menu is the thing you are looking at. The row keeps itself
  open on purpose, because zooming is two or three presses to find the right size; going full screen
  is done once, so that button now closes the menu, as the same button does in Firefox's panel.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-08

**Known gaps:**

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on. Doing it properly means intercepting the quit before `Platform.exit`.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting. Reading another process's cwd means `NtQueryInformationProcess`, a different order of
  undertaking from a `readlink`. Handling OSC 7 would cover Windows and any shell configured to
  emit it, and is not implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **A new tab opens in the current tab's directory**, instead of always starting at home. Read from
  the shell process, the same way the tab titles are, so it needs nothing of the shell. Linux and
  macOS; Windows keeps starting at home, as it did.
- **Jump straight to a tab** with `Cmd+1`…`9` on macOS, `Alt+1`…`9` elsewhere — the convention both
  platforms already use. The last digit means the *last* tab rather than the ninth, so it works in a
  session with three tabs open. Chords and palette entries only: nine menu rows would be most of the
  Window menu, and all but the first few dead most of the time.
- **Closing a tab with something running asks first.** A tab always has a shell, so the question is
  whether the shell has *children* — an idle prompt has none, and one running `vim`, an ssh session
  or a build has one, which is what keeps this from becoming a confirmation people learn to dismiss
  without reading. The dialog names what it is about to end. Background jobs count: `sleep 60 &`
  dies with the tab just as surely. Every deliberate close goes through one place — the close
  button, the menu item, the chord, Close Others, Close to the Right, and closing the window, which
  ends every tab's programs at once. A reorder and a shell that exited on its own do not ask, since
  neither ends anything. Settings → Terminal turns it off for anyone who would rather not be asked.

### Changed

- **No rule between settings rows.** A line under every row turned a page of eight settings into
  eight boxes, and the eye ended up reading the lines rather than the text. Separation is space
  now, as it is in Editora's settings — which is why the row padding grew as the border went. Row
  titles and descriptions take Editora's sizes with them, stated in px for both rather than left to
  inherit.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-08

**Known gaps:**

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows.** Reading another process's cwd there means
  `NtQueryInformationProcess`, a different order of undertaking from a `readlink`. Handling OSC 7 —
  the escape sequence a shell can send to report its directory — would cover Windows and any shell
  configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **Zoom is one row in the menus, as a browser does it** — `Zoom  −  110%  +  ⤢` — in both the View
  menu and the right-click menu, replacing the three separate Zoom In / Zoom Out / Actual Size
  items. The menu stays open while the buttons are pressed, because zooming is something you do two
  or three times to find the size you want. The percentage is itself the reset. The three actions
  keep their chords and their places in the command palette.
- **Zoom is now a level, separate from the configured font size.** It used to add a pixel to the
  font-size preference, so there was no "100%" to show and resetting the zoom silently discarded the
  size the user had chosen. `font.zoom` multiplies `font.size`; Settings still edits the size, and
  the zoom row moves through a browser's ladder (30% to 300%). **On upgrade, whatever size you had
  becomes your base at 100%** — a size previously arrived at by zooming cannot be told from one that
  was chosen.
- **Full screen** (`F11`, `Ctrl+Cmd+F` on macOS), from the zoom row and the command palette.

### Fixed

- **The terminal could still lose focus, by paths other than the one already fixed.** Making the
  tab strip non-traversable stopped it being *traversed* to; it did not stop anything calling
  `requestFocus`, which ignores that flag. A click on the already-selected tab header takes focus
  without changing the selection, so the listener that follows a tab switch never runs — and the
  strip's empty space, a drag that reorders nothing, and the menu bar after its menu closes all do
  the same. Every one of them presents as a window that looks ready and swallows typing, which is
  why the report behind this could not be reproduced. The terminal now takes focus back whenever
  nothing else has a claim on it; while the palette, a menu or the context menu is open, focus is
  left exactly where it is.

- **A directory listing's columns still did not line up.** Fixing the advance *within* a style run
  left the run's *starting* position measured in the wrong unit: JediTerm hands the renderer an
  index into the line's `char[]`, not its column, and the two disagree by one for every astral
  character earlier in the line — which with `eza --icons` is one per name. The drift accumulates,
  so a row with two icons ended two columns right of a row with one and the listing diverged the
  further right you looked. The emulated grid was correct throughout; only the drawing was wrong.
- **Selecting a line with icons copied text a column off from what it highlighted.** The same
  disagreement in the other direction: a mouse position and a highlight rectangle are columns,
  while a selection is handed to JediTerm, which indexes the line's `char[]`. Dragging across
  `Desktop … Downloads … Games` copied `…Game`. Whole-line and select-all were bounded by the
  column count too, which cut the tail off any line carrying more slots than the grid has columns.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-08

**Known gaps:**

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows.** Reading another process's cwd there means
  `NtQueryInformationProcess`, a different order of undertaking from a `readlink`. Handling OSC 7 —
  the escape sequence a shell can send to report its directory — would cover Windows and any shell
  configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- **Windows is still unrun by a human.** CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **Tabs and the title bar show the working directory**, read from the shell process itself rather
  than waiting to be told. The usual channel is an escape sequence the prompt emits, and any prompt
  framework that replaces `PS1` — Oh My Bash, Starship, powerlevel10k — quietly drops it; with one
  of those installed every tab was labelled "Termina" and none could be told from another. The title
  bar gets the path (`~/src/adl/Termina`), the tab its last segment (`Termina`), and a title a
  program sets for itself still wins. Linux and macOS.
- **Zoom In, Zoom Out and Actual Size in the right-click menu**, plus **Show Menu Bar** as a
  checkbox — the View menu keeps its "Hide Menu Bar" verb, because it lives inside the bar and can
  only be opened while the bar is showing. The right-click menu is the one you reach once the bar is
  gone, so it states which state you are in, and is now the direct way back.

### Fixed

- **Nothing could be typed into the first window until a second tab was opened.** The scene gives
  initial focus to the first focus-traversable node, and a `TabPane` is one — so it raced the
  terminal's own focus request and, on a cold launch where there is a JVM to warm and a shell to
  start, won. The window looked completely ready with every keystroke going to the tab strip. No
  part of the chrome is focus-traversable now, so the terminal is the only thing focus can land on.
- **The Linux launcher showed a stock Java icon.** `--icon` reaches the app image but not the deb
  and rpm bundlers, which regenerate `lib/Termina.png` from their own resources — the 0.1.0 packages
  shipped a file byte-identical to jpackage's generic 32×32 `JavaApp.png`. The icon is now staged
  into the jpackage resource directory, which is the only override those bundlers honour.
- **Development builds were told daily to update to the release they are ahead of.** Only releases
  are ever offered, so the version compared against has to be a release too — and a snapshot is not
  one. `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` now counts as `0.1.0` rather than sorting below it, while a genuinely newer
  release is still offered. Release candidates are unaffected: an `-rc1` really does precede its
  release.
- **Dismissing the update-check result revealed a stale "Checking for updates…" behind it.** The
  check reports twice — once when it starts, once when it finishes — and each report opened its own
  alert instead of replacing the first, so the two stacked and were dismissed in reverse order.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-07

First release.

**Known gaps:**

- **Windows and Linux are unrun.** The code paths exist and pty4j carries every platform's natives, but
  only macOS has actually been exercised.
- **Installers are not built and nothing is signed — `-Pdist` produces an app image, and macOS will
  refuse a downloaded copy until it is signed and notarised.**
- **Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background).** Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- **No tab reordering, no splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.**

### Added

- **Tabs and multiple windows.** Each tab owns its own shell; each window its own tab strip and menu
  bar. Settings, the preferences window and the theme are shared across all of them.
- **Menu bar** — File, Edit, View, Window, Help — using the macOS system menu bar where there is
  one. Menu items and key bindings come from a single definition, so the menu cannot advertise a
  shortcut nothing implements.
- **Right-click menu**: New Tab, New Window, Copy, Paste, Select All, Clear Scrollback, Settings.
  Suppressed while a program has grabbed the mouse; Shift forces it.
- **Settings window** (`Cmd/Ctrl+,`): theme, font family and size, cursor shape, visual bell,
  scrollback depth, shell, Alt-as-Meta, and hiding the tab bar. Live apply, no OK button.
- **Themes**: Editora Dark and Light (Caret & Ink), plus **Clear Dark** and **Clear Light** ported
  from macOS Terminal with colours read out of Apple's own profiles.
- **Menu bar can be hidden** (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M`), on the platforms that draw one in the window.
- **Tabs tile the window width** and shrink as more are added, with a **+** button in the strip.
- **Per-tab right-click menu**: new, close, close others, close to the right, move left/right.
- **Window title follows the selected tab**, as macOS Terminal does.
- **Optional scrollbar** for the scrollback (Appearance → Window), palette-coloured.
- **Tab-strip glyphs matched in size and alignment; dragging the scrollbar no longer selects text.**
- **Window size is remembered** across launches, clamped to the current screen.
- **Fixed**: a Nerd Font icon (or any emoji) in a directory listing shifted the rest of its line one
  column right, so columns did not line up between rows.
- **Command palette** (Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+P) over every menu command, plus the colour themes.
- **Debug log** in Advanced → Diagnostics, mirrored to a file beside the settings.
- **Six interface languages** (en/it/es/fr/pt/de), picked in Appearance → Language.
- **Window opacity** (Appearance → Window), clamped so it cannot hide the window that undoes it.
- **Bundled fonts**: five monospace families plus Inter for the interface, so a terminal looks the
  same on every platform. JetBrains Mono is now the default.
- **Tooltip on the new-tab button; "Hide Menu Bar" no longer appears in the menu on macOS.**
- **Tab reordering** by drag, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right`.
- **Tab bar hides itself** while only one tab is open, reclaiming the row for the terminal.
- **About window** and an **update check** against GitHub releases, throttled to once a day and
  disableable.
- **Selection and copy**: drag, double-click for a word, triple-click for a line.
- **Mouse reporting**, so vim positions its cursor and htop responds to clicks. On the alternate
  screen the wheel falls back to arrow keys, so `less` and `man` scroll without it.
- **Application icon**, carried into window icons and the macOS/Windows/Linux installer formats.
- **Native app image** via `-Pdist` (moditect + jlink + jpackage), and a Maven wrapper so a system
  Maven is not required.

### Fixed

- **Tab and Escape did nothing, and Tab froze the terminal.** Neither is in JediTerm's key encoder,
  and both are control characters the typed-character path drops, so they never reached the shell —
  and the unconsumed Tab moved focus out of the terminal, so everything typed after it went
  elsewhere.
- **A hidden menu bar painted over the terminal**, overlapping the first rows of output.
