# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org); until
1.0.0 the minor number moves for anything user-visible.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Create the sync repository from Settings.** Where the GitHub CLI is installed and signed in,
  Settings → Sync has Create on GitHub… beside Connect: it asks for a name (`termina-sync`), makes a
  private repository with `gh repo create`, and connects to it — over SSH if that is the protocol
  `gh` is set to, HTTPS otherwise. As in Editora.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-10-25

Split panes, scrollback search, shell integration and shortcuts that can all be changed. Four
requests programs make of a terminal — a declared link, the clipboard, the directory, a
notification — are honoured rather than dropped, typing over a slow SSH link is predicted, programs
can ask for the kitty keyboard protocol, and an idle terminal lets the machine idle. Selection
autoscrolls, makes blocks and survives typing; panes maximize, move and reopen as they were; themes
can be imported from six other terminals' formats; and a profile can have its own font and theme.

### Added

- **Selection does more.** Dragging past the top or bottom edge scrolls and keeps selecting, faster
  the further out, with the pointer held still. Alt+drag (Option on macOS, Ctrl+Alt where the window
  manager takes Alt) selects a block, copied a row per line. Copy on select is a setting on
  Terminal → Input. On Linux a selection is the PRIMARY selection and a middle-click pastes it,
  through `wl-paste`/`wl-copy` or `xclip`/`xsel`.
- **Maximize, move and drag panes.** Window → Maximize Pane (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Enter`) shows the
  active pane alone, with the others still running. Move Pane to New Tab, palette rows to move it
  into any other tab, and Cmd+Option+Shift-drag (Ctrl+Alt+Shift elsewhere) onto a tab or the strip.
  Reopen Closed Tab brings a split tab back with every pane, arranged as it was.
- **Desktop notifications (OSC 9, OSC 777).** A program's notification marks its tab with a dot that
  outranks the bell's, and reaches the desktop unless you are looking at that pane: `notify-send`
  or the session bus on Linux, `osascript` on macOS, a toast on Windows. Terminal → Display turns the
  desktop half off.
- **Import a theme.** Settings → Appearance → Import… reads iTerm2 `.itermcolors`, Terminal
  `.terminal`, Windows Terminal schemes or `settings.json`, and Ghostty, kitty and Alacritty themes,
  colours taken exactly as written. Remove deletes one again.
- **A profile's own font, size and theme**, on Settings → Profiles, for any profile including the
  system shell. They follow the pane through splits, duplicates, moves and reopening.
- **Windows tabs know their directory without OSC 7.** It is read out of the shell process. A
  directory the shell reports still wins there, since a WSL tab's process is `wsl.exe`.

- **The kitty keyboard protocol.** A program that asks — Neovim, Vim, Helix, fish and nushell do —
  gets unambiguous keys: Escape on its own, Ctrl+I apart from Tab, Shift+Enter as a key of its own,
  and with the further flags repeats and releases, the shifted key, every key including the
  modifiers, and the text each types. Each screen keeps its own mode, a query is answered, and
  `reset` clears it. Nothing changes for a program that does not ask.

- **Split panes.** Window → Split Right and Split Down (`Cmd+D`/`Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS,
  `Ctrl+Shift+E`/`Ctrl+Shift+O` elsewhere) open another shell beside or below the one you are in,
  same shell, same directory. `Cmd+Option+arrows` (`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+arrows`) or a click moves between
  them, and the pane being typed in is outlined. Close Tab's chord closes the active pane of a split
  tab, and the menu says "Close Pane" while it does; a shell that exits closes its own pane. The tab
  is titled after the active pane.
- **Search the scrollback.** Edit → Find… (`Cmd+F`/`Ctrl+Shift+F`) opens a find bar in the pane:
  every match highlighted as you type, the current one outlined, Enter stepping up to older output
  and Shift+Enter down. Smart case, an optional regular expression, and a word that wrapped at the
  edge is still found. Find Next and Find Previous work from anywhere (`Cmd+G`/`Cmd+Shift+G`,
  `Ctrl+Shift+G`/`Ctrl+Shift+H`), and a short selection becomes the query.
- **Shell integration (OSC 133).** A shell that marks its prompts gets Edit → Previous Prompt and
  Next Prompt (`Cmd+Up`/`Cmd+Down`, `Ctrl+Shift+Up`/`Down`), Select Last Output, and a red bar beside
  the prompt of a command that failed. The README has the lines to add to bash and zsh. The marks
  stay on their prompts through a resize.
- **Links a program declares (OSC 8)** are clickable — `ls --hyperlink`, compilers, `gh`. Hovering
  one shows where it really goes at the bottom of the pane, and only the schemes a link in the text
  may use are accepted, so a `javascript:` target is not a link.
- **Programs can copy to the clipboard (OSC 52)**, which is how vim and tmux copy over SSH. Never
  read it. Terminal → Input turns it off.
- **On Windows, a shell that reports its directory (OSC 7)** gives its tab a directory: new tabs
  open there and relative paths become links. Only a directory on this machine that exists.
- **Type-ahead over slow SSH.** While `ssh` runs and the far end echoes slower than 100 ms, typed
  characters appear at once, dimmed and underlined until confirmed. JediTerm's predictor decides
  when; a local shell is never predicted. Terminal → Input turns it off.

- **Every shortcut can be changed.** Settings has a Keyboard page listing each command under its
  menu: click a shortcut and press the new one. A shortcut another command has moves on a second
  press, Backspace removes one, and Reset or Reset All Shortcuts puts them back. Commands with no
  shortcut of their own, such as Rename Tab, can be given one. The menus, the palette, the shortcut
  reference and the tab strip's tooltips follow the change at once. The command palette's shortcut,
  which had a row of its own on the Terminal page, is now one of these and keeps its stored value.
- **Key bindings sync between computers.** Settings → Sync connects Termina to a private Git
  repository you own; the shortcuts you change are pushed there and picked up by every other
  connected computer — after startup, half a minute after a change, every 15 minutes while a window
  is in front, or on Sync Now. Macs share one list and Windows and Linux another, since a chord means
  a different key on each. A shortcut changed on two computers keeps the version of the one that
  syncs; bindings a sync replaces are copied to `sync/backups` first, and a sync that would remove
  most of them stops and asks. Git signs in with your credential helper or SSH key and an automatic
  sync never prompts; a URL with a password or token in it is refused. With several GitHub CLI
  accounts (`gh auth switch`), sync finds the one that can read an `https://` repository, remembers
  it, and keeps signing in as it whichever account is active; the Sync page names it. File → Sync
  Settings Now (also in the palette) syncs from anywhere and says how it went. A settings folder
  inside a dotfiles repository that does not ignore `sync/` is refused rather than nested.
- **Icons draw correctly without a Nerd Font installed.** Symbols Nerd Font Mono 3.5.1 is bundled
  with the other faces and used for private-use code points when no Nerd Font build of the
  terminal's own face is installed. Its icons are drawn a cell and a half wide, the size the Nerd
  Font builds draw theirs, and Powerline separators still span the line so a prompt's segments
  meet. It has no letters, so it is kept out of the font picker.

### Changed

- **A keystroke no longer clears the selection.** It goes when the text under it changes.
- **Middle-click pastes PRIMARY on Linux** where a tool to read it is installed, rather than the
  clipboard.

- **An idle terminal lets the machine idle.** Each tab used to keep a repaint timer running from
  open to close, which held JavaFX at 60 frames a second with nothing to draw. The timer now runs
  only while there is something to paint. With one tab sitting at a prompt, CPU use went from
  2–3% of a core to 0.8%.
- **Background tabs stop painting.** A tab that is not selected keeps its output and paints it
  when you switch to it, instead of drawing every frame into a canvas nobody can see. A build
  running in another tab no longer competes with the one you are typing in. Activity and bell
  marks on the tab still update.
- **Knowing what a tab is running costs microseconds.** The title and the close prompt learn a
  shell's running program by asking the OS for that process's children directly, instead of
  reading the whole process table every 750 ms per tab. That was 3.4 ms a call on a desktop with
  610 processes, about a tenth of a core at twenty tabs.
- **The first window paints sooner.** Opening a tab checks only the font it is going to use.
  Measuring every installed font, about 100 ms on a Linux desktop, now happens only when the font
  picker in Settings needs the list.
- **Less work per frame and per setting.** Truecolour cells reuse their colours rather than
  allocating new ones every frame. A settings change rebuilds fonts only if the family or size
  changed, and a burst of window-title updates from a program is applied once.

### Fixed

- **Closing one window of several left its shells running** until the app quit, with their threads
  and directory polls. A window's tabs are now disposed however it closes.
- **A drag held while output scrolled extended from the wrong text**: the anchor did not move with
  its line as the selection did.

- **A stray `¯` or `ÿ` before some icons in `eza` and `ls` listings.** With no Nerd Font face
  chosen, JavaFX drew private-use icons in the first installed font that claimed the code point,
  and some ordinary fonts do: Arial maps the icon eza uses for a symlinked file. Icons are now
  drawn in an installed Nerd Font, or the bundled one.
- **Drag-selecting while output arrived could read a line mid-write.** The mouse handlers read the
  screen without the lock the emulator writes under. They now take it.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-10-23

An icon beside each page in the settings sidebar. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number
moves.

### Added

- **The settings sidebar has icons.** Appearance has a palette, Terminal a prompt window, Profiles
  stacked layers and Advanced sliders — Material glyphs, the same family as the context menu's.
  They are muted at rest and take the accent colour when their page is selected, and each sits in
  a box of fixed width so the labels beside them line up.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-21

The command palette is now Editora's: the same card, the same matcher and ranking, and Emacs keys
to drive it. It opens on Alt+X instead of Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+P, and the chord is a setting. The
default chord changed, so the minor number moves.

### Changed

- **The command palette is Editora's.** Same card: the query row led by a chip naming the chord
  that opened it, eight rows with the matched characters emboldened, a line describing the
  highlighted command, and a legend of the keys. Same matcher, so the two palettes rank alike —
  "tab close" finds Close Tab with the words in either order, and "file new" reaches New Tab
  through the menu it lives in. Ties go to the shorter, then the alphabetical label, so equal rows
  stop shuffling under the cursor between keystrokes. A command that cannot run right now (Reopen
  Closed Tab with nothing to reopen) is listed greyed with the reason as its tooltip instead of
  dropped, and the cursor steps over it. A click on a row runs it.
- **It opens on Alt+X**, Emacs's M-x and the chord Editora's palette answers to, instead of
  Shift+Ctrl/Cmd+P. The chord is a setting (Terminal → Keyboard): click the field and press another
  one. A bare key is refused because the shell owns it, and so is a chord another command already
  has, because the first binding on a chord is the only one that runs. A hand-edited line that does
  not parse, or names a taken chord, falls back to Alt+X rather than leaving the palette with no
  way in.
- **Emacs keys in the palette.** Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P move, Ctrl+V and Alt+V page, Alt+< and Alt+>
  jump to the ends, Ctrl+G cancels — token for token Editora's Emacs keymap — and the query field
  takes Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+F, Ctrl+B, Alt+F, Alt+B, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+K, Alt+D, Ctrl+W, Alt+W, Ctrl+Y
  and Ctrl+/. The legend under the list names them in the platform's notation, the same one the
  menus use.

### Fixed

- The chord that opens the palette no longer leaks its typed character: on macOS Option+X also
  composes "≈", which landed in the query field the chord had just focused.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-21

The fixes from the 2026-10-20 review, and the features that fell out of it: tabs can be renamed,
reopened and duplicated and say when something happened in them, there is a searchable list of
every keyboard shortcut, a paste with a line break asks first, and the menu bar can share a row
with the title bar. Moved to JavaFX 27. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number moves.

### Added

- **The menu bar can share a row with the title bar.** Appearance → Window → "Put the menu bar in
  the title bar" merges the two: menus at the left, the window title in the middle, the window
  buttons at the right, and the terminal gains the row the native title bar took. Off by default.
  It applies to windows opened after the change, because a window's style is fixed when it is
  first shown, and the row says so. Not offered on macOS, where the menus are in the screen menu
  bar and there is nothing in the window to merge.

- **A paste with a line break asks first.** At a prompt every line of a paste runs the moment it
  lands, which is how a copied snippet with a stray newline becomes an executed command. The prompt
  shows the text that will be sent, with Paste as the default button; Terminal → Input turns it
  off. Pasted text is also sanitised: escape and other control characters are stripped before a
  (bracketed) paste, so clipboard contents can no longer end the bracket early and run as typing.
- **Keyboard scrollback and the Linux paste reflexes.** Shift+PageUp, Shift+PageDown, Shift+Home
  and Shift+End move through the scrollback (and reach the program as before on the alternate
  screen); Shift+Insert pastes, Ctrl+Insert copies, and middle-click pastes the clipboard — JavaFX
  has no access to the X11 primary selection, so it is the clipboard rather than the selection.
- **Tabs are named after the running program** — `vim`, `ssh`, `npm` — when the shell has not set
  a title, and only then after the directory. Three tabs in `~` were three tabs called `~`.
- **Advanced → Updates** carries the switch for the startup update check, which existed only as a
  key in the file. About says when the last check ran.
- **Inline validation** under the shell field and a profile's command and starting directory:
  "Not found", "Not executable", "Not a directory", as you type. A shell path that names nothing
  was silently replaced by `$SHELL`, and the row never said so.
- **Rename, reopen and duplicate a tab.** Double-click a tab (or use its menu, the Window menu or
  the palette) to give it a name; the name outranks the shell's title and the program, and an
  empty name brings the automatic title back. **Reopen Closed Tab** (`Cmd+Z` on macOS,
  `Ctrl+Shift+Z` elsewhere; File menu) brings back the last tab closed on purpose — the same shell
  or profile, the directory it was in when it closed, its name, and its old place in the strip —
  not its scrollback, since the process is gone. The last ten are kept; a shell that exited by
  itself is not among them. **Duplicate Tab** opens a second tab like this one, where it is now,
  right beside it.
- **Help → Keyboard Shortcuts** (`Cmd+/` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+/` elsewhere) lists every chord
  the window answers to, searchable, generated from the menus and the binding table rather than
  typed — so it cannot advertise a chord the filter does not implement — plus the keys the terminal
  handles by itself: Shift+PageUp and friends, Shift+Insert, Ctrl+Insert, middle-click, the link
  modifier, Shift+drag and double-click to rename.
- **A background tab says when something happened in it.** A dot after the title: accent for
  output that arrived after two quiet seconds — a build finishing, a prompt returning — and the
  warning colour for a bell. Selecting the tab clears it. A tab that streams continuously is marked
  once and left alone; a new tab's own first prompt does not count.
- **The window's last position is remembered** along with its size, and pulled back onto a screen
  that still exists.

### Fixed

- **Escape no longer leaves full screen.** JavaFX's default full-screen exit key is Escape,
  handled before the terminal sees it, and it painted a "Press ESC to exit full screen" banner over
  the shell — so the first Escape in vim dropped the window out of full screen instead of leaving
  insert mode. F11 (Ctrl+Cmd+F on macOS) is now the only way in and out. Verified by pressing the
  key through the operating system.
- **Close Window has a chord that works.** Off macOS it was `Ctrl+Shift+W`, the same chord as
  Close Tab, which the key filter reached first; the File menu and the palette advertised a binding
  that did nothing. It is now `Ctrl+Shift+Q`, GNOME Terminal's and Konsole's. macOS keeps
  `Cmd+Shift+W`. Registering two bindings on one chord now fails loudly, and the chord table is
  tested for duplicates on both platform branches.
- **A default profile that cannot start no longer closes the window.** The failed tab was removed
  before the error was shown; an empty window closes itself, the last window closing quits, and the
  dialog then opened on a dead owner — leaving nobody a window to fix the profile from. The error
  now names the command that failed, the default shell opens in its place when the window would
  otherwise be empty, and the dialog is an explanation rather than a gate.
- **The tab strip's overflow is drawn, not hidden.** With more tabs than fit, JavaFX's overflow
  control and the last tab's close button were painted under the floating `+`; the strip now keeps
  its right end clear and the controls there are opaque, so a scrolled tab ends where they begin.
- **Zoom In's menu says `Ctrl+=`**, the key every common layout actually produces, instead of
  `Ctrl++`. A real `+` key and the keypad's still zoom.

- **A selection and a scrolled-back view stay on their text as output arrives**, including once
  the scrollback is full. The shift was driven from JediTerm's history-buffer listener, which (in
  3.76) fires only when history is cleared or the buffer resized — never for an ordinary newline —
  so a selection made while a build ran came to highlight different text from what copying it
  produced, and reading a log while it grew slid it along under the pointer. Driven from the model
  listener now, with the resize path left to JediTerm, which shifts the selection itself; a
  regression test writes into a real buffer and checks the selected text is unchanged.
- **A drag highlights exactly what it copies.** Highlighting treated the end cell as inclusive and
  copying as exclusive, so dragging to the last letter of a word lost it. One convention now: the
  cell under the pointer is included once the pointer passes its middle, and a backward drag keeps
  the pressed cell.
- **No phantom selections inside mouse-aware programs.** A click reported to the program left the
  previous plain click's anchor behind, and a later drag in a press-only mode selected from it.
- **A program that resets the terminal gives the cursor back its configured shape.** The reset
  arrived as "no shape" and was ignored, so vim's block outlived vim.
- **Wheel and trackpad scrolling move by distance**, not three lines per event — trackpads send
  many small events, so scrollback flew past.
- **Reset to Defaults asks first, and keeps your profiles**, the default-profile choice and hidden
  profiles. It cleared the whole file, profiles included, on one click.
- **The settings file is written atomically** — to a sibling and moved into place — so a crash or
  power loss mid-write cannot leave it empty. A save that fails is shown in red on the Settings
  file row instead of being logged and forgotten.
- **The Settings window follows changes made elsewhere while it is open** — a theme from the
  palette, the menu bar from its chord, zoom. A stale checkbox used to need two clicks, the first
  of which did nothing.
- **Settings and About no longer close with the window that opened them.** They were owned by the
  first window to open them, for life.
- **Update-check errors are readable** — "You appear to be offline", "GitHub refused the request"
  — rather than a Java class name, and after the release page has been opened the Help item goes
  back to "Check for Updates…" instead of advertising the same version until restart.
- **Font size and scrollback accept "13px"-style input** instead of throwing on the FX thread.
- **A second running instance no longer wipes the first one's session log.**
- **Ctrl+Alt+letter sends Meta plus the control byte** (readline's `C-M-f`), Ctrl+3 through Ctrl+8
  send xterm's control bytes, and the keypad arrows work with NumLock off. Programs that ask for
  any-motion mouse reporting (mode 1003) now receive pointer motion.
- **Rendering.** The cursor is drawn on the last column when a line is exactly full; a block
  cursor shows the glyph beneath it in the cell's own font and colours; rows are at least as tall
  as the font's metrics ask, so descenders are no longer overpainted by a coloured row below; box
  drawing, block and braille characters stay on the batched fast path instead of one draw call per
  glyph; a window resize reflows the terminal once the size settles rather than on every pixel;
  a thousand bells are one flash; and a selection is cleared when a full-screen program starts or
  exits rather than drawn over it.
- **Closing a tab no longer pauses the window for up to half a second** waiting for its threads.
- **Child shells get `LANG=C.UTF-8`** rather than `en_US.UTF-8` when no locale is set — the
  latter is often not generated on minimal systems and bash said so at every prompt — and
  `LC_ALL`/`LC_CTYPE` are respected. "Automatic" interface language no longer narrows the JVM's
  locale to a bare language, which changed dates and numbers in dialogs.
- **New windows cascade from the window the action came from** and stay on its screen.
- **On Windows, Ctrl+click opens files through the shell handler** rather than `cmd /c start`, so
  `&`, `^` and `%` in a name are not interpreted. (Still unrun on Windows.)
- Settings search prefers a match in a row's title and opens that row's page; the profiles note
  names the platform's own chord; the shell field's prompt is translated; row titles and
  checkboxes are labelled for screen readers; arrow keys in the settings sidebar skip the group
  headers; Escape closes Settings, About and the Debug Log. `NaN` in a hand-edited settings file
  is treated as absent rather than handed to the font.

### Changed

- **The palette lists the tabs that exist, by title**, with the chord that reaches each, instead of
  nine numbered "Go to Tab" rows of which most were dead. Its menu-bar row says "Show" or "Hide"
  according to the current state.

- **`sh` and `dash` are no longer offered as shell profiles**, and shells that are symlinks to
  the same binary are listed once. Nobody opens a tab as `dash`.
- The cursor's DECSCUSR 0 ("default") still arrives from JediTerm as a blinking block,
  indistinguishable from an explicit 1, so a program that resets to "default" rather than to "no
  shape" still leaves a block. Said here because the fix above covers the other case.

### Maintenance

- Moved to JavaFX 27. Its extended stage style (`StageStyle.EXTENDED` and `HeaderBar`), a preview
  feature in 25 and 26, is final there and is what the title-bar option is built on.
- `scripts/dev-run.sh` now clears `target/deps` before refilling it, so a dependency bump cannot
  leave the old jar beside the new one with the old one winning.
- Dependencies brought up to date: JediTerm 3.76 (mouse-scroll direction fix, faster double-width
  checks), pty4j 0.14.0 (`Cleaner` instead of `finalize`, a fix for `breakRead` waking the wrong
  PTY after a close, retries when opening the PTY master, ConPTY 1.24), Kotlin stdlib 2.4.21, slf4j
  2.0.20, Jackson 2.22.4 and JUnit 6.1. Build plugins likewise: Spotless 3.10.4 with
  palantir-java-format 2.102.0 (one reflow), JaCoCo 0.8.15, ModiTect 1.3.0, jpackage-maven-plugin
  1.8.0, the compiler, surefire, dependency and exec plugins, and Maven 3.9.16 in the wrapper.
  antrun stays at 3.1.0, because 3.2.0 warns about every exported property.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-09-30

Fixes for keyboard input, shell-profile startup, and commands that could hang discovery or the
interface. No new features, so the patch number moves.

### Fixed

- **Opening a file link no longer blocks the interface.** Resolving the configured editor command
  can start a login shell to read its PATH; that work now runs on the launcher worker.
- **AltGr characters reach the shell.** Ctrl+Alt combinations used to compose characters such as
  `@` are no longer sent as control chords or discarded by the typed-character handler.
- **Startup respects the selected shell profile.** When the saved default needs discovery, the
  first session waits for the result instead of opening the system shell prematurely. Command-line
  commands still launch immediately, and `-d` still takes precedence over a profile's directory.
- **Login-shell PATH and WSL discovery enforce their five-second deadlines.** A command that keeps
  stdout open can no longer bypass the timeout. Timed-out processes are terminated.

### Maintenance

- Added regressions for AltGr input, deferred profile startup, asynchronous link-command resolution,
  and subprocess timeouts and output limits.
- Made the working-directory integration test retry its harmless `cd` command until shell startup
  accepts input.
- Corrected Linux installer validation to select a regular desktop-entry file rather than the
  bundled JDK's `java.desktop` directory.
- Updated release-page installation instructions for the native installers and published checksum
  filename.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-08-12

A tab can be opened as any shell the machine has, rather than only as the one shell a setting could
name. New user-visible behaviour, so the minor number moves.

### Added

- **Shell profiles.** A terminal on Windows is not one program — Command Prompt, Windows PowerShell,
  PowerShell 7 and every installed WSL distribution are separate shells with separate command lines,
  and a single "path to your shell" setting can only ever name one of them. A profile is a name, a
  command and optionally a directory, and a window now offers all of them: a chevron beside the `+`
  drops the list, **File ▸ New Tab With** carries the same entries, the command palette lists them by
  name, and `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+1` through `9` open the first nine.

  What is on the list is **found, not configured**. On Windows that is both PowerShells (7 first — it
  is the one somebody installed on purpose), Command Prompt, Git Bash, and each WSL distribution, with
  Docker Desktop's and Rancher's internal pseudo-distributions left out. On macOS and Linux it is the
  shells named in `/etc/shells` and on the path — zsh, bash, fish, nushell and the rest — one entry
  per shell rather than one per binary, and each started with the login flag it actually understands
  rather than a blanket `-l`. Nothing found is written down: uninstall a shell and it leaves the menu
  rather than becoming an entry that fails to start.

  Your own shell is always first and can never be hidden, so a machine where nothing is found offers
  exactly what it did before this existed. Anything else can be hidden, and you can add profiles of
  your own — `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu`, a shell on a server, a directory you keep coming back to — in
  **Settings ▸ Profiles** or by hand in `settings.properties`, which is where the whole list lives.

- **Marks in the profile menu.** Each entry carries its shell's or distribution's own glyph, so the
  list reads as a set of shells rather than a column of words — recognising the Ubuntu circle is
  faster than reading "Ubuntu (WSL)". The marks are Simple Icons, CC0 (see NOTICE). Microsoft's are
  not among them: PowerShell, Windows and Windows Terminal have been withdrawn from that collection
  over trademark, so Command Prompt and both PowerShells carry a generic prompt drawn for Termina
  rather than a lookalike.

- **`-Dtermina.captureProfiles=true`** opens the profile dropdown and reports what is in it. The list
  is assembled from what a machine has, so on Windows this is the only way to see the entries the
  feature exists for.

### Changed

- **The chevron beside the `+` is a stroked glyph rather than a filled triangle.** Everything else on
  the tab strip — the `+`, every close button — is a thin outline, and a solid ▼ among them read as
  the heaviest thing in the row, which is backwards for the subordinate half of a pair.

- **A command given with `-e` still replaces the shell, and `-d` still wins over a profile's own
  starting directory.** One is an instruction for this launch; the other is a standing preference.

### Known gaps

Unchanged from 0.6.2, except that the first entry below is new and the Windows one has grown teeth.

- **The Windows half of shell profiles has not run on Windows.** Every branch of discovery is driven
  in tests with the filesystem and `wsl.exe` probes replaced, and CI builds and packages Windows on
  every commit — but "PowerShell 7 is installed at that path" and "`wsl --list` answers in that
  shape" are claims about a machine, not about code, and nothing in a test can check them.
  `-Dtermina.captureProfiles=true` prints every entry a machine found and the command it runs; that
  is the check. The macOS and Linux halves are exercised the same way and the macOS one is
  device-tested.
- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.
- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7
  would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-08-11

Interface fixes and polish. No new behaviour, so the patch number moves.

### Changed

- **The zoom row separates full screen from the zoom controls.** The minus, the percentage and the plus
  are one control — a value with a decrement and an increment — while full screen is a different action
  that happens to share the row, and the only button there that closes the menu. It now sits a little
  apart instead of flush against the plus. The row does not get wider: the gap comes out of the space
  between the label and the controls.

- **"Colour theme" is now "Color theme."** The only British spelling in the interface. Its Settings
  search still matches both, so typing either word finds the row.

### Fixed

- **Tabs can be dragged to reorder them.** They always could, in principle: the gesture, the drop-side
  detection and the accent edge showing where the tab would land have been there since tabs were. It was
  installed on the title *label*, though, and a tab is a great deal wider than its name — measured on a
  three-tab window, 286 pixels of tab and 13 of label. Unless you caught the two characters of text,
  nothing happened, which from the outside is a terminal that cannot reorder tabs. The gesture now covers
  the whole tab, and what follows the pointer is the tab rather than its text.

### Known gaps

Unchanged from 0.6.1.

- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.
- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.

  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.

  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7

  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-08-11

Two fixes to the clickable links 0.6.0 introduced, and a set of dependency bumps. No new behaviour, so
the patch number moves rather than the minor.

### Fixed

- **"Could not run Editora" said nothing about what to do.** Typing an application's name into
  *Open files with* is the obvious thing to try, and on macOS there is usually no command by that
  name — the program lives inside the bundle. The message now distinguishes a command that names
  nothing on this machine from one that would not start, and says what a working value looks like.

- **A configured command is now found the way the user's shell would find it.** An application
  launched from Finder or a desktop entry inherits a stripped `PATH` — no Homebrew, no
  `~/.local/bin`, nothing a version manager added — so a command that runs perfectly in a terminal
  was simply not there from a click. The PATH is taken from a login shell, asked once and only when
  a bare command actually has to be resolved.

### Internal

- Routine dependency bumps: pty4j 0.13.10 → 0.13.12, JNA 5.17.0 → 5.19.1, Jackson 2.22.1, JUnit 5.14.4.
  All patch or minor.

  Checked against a packaged build rather than the suite alone, because pty4j ships the native libraries
  for every platform and JNA is how they are found — and those survive packaging by an accident of JPMS
  rather than by design (see the note in the README). The built app image starts a real shell and runs a
  command in it.

### Known gaps

Unchanged from 0.6.0.

- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.

  warn.

  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.

  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks

  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7

  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-10

The minor number moves for the clickable links; the Meta fix goes with it, and it is the one to read
first if any keyboard chord has ever behaved oddly for you.

### Added

- **Clickable links.** Cmd-click on macOS, Ctrl-click elsewhere, opens what is under the pointer:
  URLs go to the browser, and **paths go to the file** — including a `Foo.java:42:7` out of a stack
  trace or a compiler error. Hold the modifier and a link underlines itself and the pointer becomes
  a hand, so the gesture announces itself; the right-click menu carries **Open Link** and **Copy
  Link Address** for anyone who never finds it. A URL that wraps at the right edge is one link, not
  two.

  A path is only a link when it names a file that **exists**, resolved against that tab's own shell
  directory — which is what makes it usable rather than a screen full of underlined words, since no
  pattern can tell a filename from an ordinary word but the filesystem can. Only `http`, `https`,
  `ftp`, `ftps`, `file` and `mailto` are ever opened as URLs: terminal output is untrusted text, and
  a `javascript:` or an `app://` handler would be a click away from running something.

  Files open in whatever the desktop opens them with. **Settings ▸ Terminal ▸ Links** takes a
  command instead — `editora {file}:{line}` — which is the only way the line number survives, since
  `open` and `xdg-open` take a file and nothing else.

- **Hovering a tab shows its directory**, in full, with the home directory abbreviated as a shell
  writes it. The tab itself is a hundred-odd pixels and JavaFX ellipsises from the end, so it can
  only carry a name; the hover is where the path fits. It keeps showing the directory even when a
  program has set the tab's title — a tab reading `vim` has already said what is running, and where
  it is running has nowhere else to appear. Nothing is shown on Windows, which cannot yet report a
  shell's directory at all.

### Fixed

- **`M-f` and every other Meta chord typed garbage instead of running its command.** On macOS Option
  is a compose key — Option+F is `ƒ` — and the escape was being prefixed to *that*, so `M-f` went out
  as `1b c6 92`. A shell reads the escape as the meta prefix, takes the `c6` with it, and is left
  holding a lone UTF-8 continuation byte, which it renders as an unprintable box wherever the cursor
  was. So the whole readline word-movement and word-killing set — `M-f`, `M-b`, `M-d`, `M-u`, `M-l`
  and the rest — inserted a stray character instead of doing anything.

  Meta is now encoded from the key press, where the key is still the key, rather than from the typed
  event, which by then reports whatever the OS composed. Alt with Ctrl is left alone, because that
  combination is AltGr on Windows and Linux and composing is exactly what it is for.

### Known gaps

Unchanged from 0.5.1, plus the first entry below.

- **OSC 8 hyperlinks are not honoured.** Links are found by looking at the text on screen, so one an
  application declares explicitly — `ls --hyperlink`, some build tools — is only clickable when its
  visible text happens to be the target. See issue #11.
- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting — which also means no tab tooltip and no relative-path links there. Handling OSC 7
  would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-08-10

Two fixes, no new behaviour, so the patch number moves rather than the minor.

### Fixed

- **macOS had no menus at all.** Not in the screen menu bar and not in the window: File, Edit, View,
  Window and Help were unreachable, leaving only the chords, the command palette and the right-click
  menu. JavaFX refuses `useSystemMenuBar` for the whole bar when any menu holds a custom item —
  AppKit draws those menus and cannot render a JavaFX node — and the zoom row is one, so the menus
  fell back into the window, where macOS collapses the bar to nothing on the assumption that the
  screen has them. The View menu now shows Zoom In, Zoom Out, Actual Size and Full Screen as
  ordinary items on macOS, which is what the platform can draw, and keeps the row everywhere else
  and in the right-click menu on every platform. Should a custom item reach the bar again, the
  in-window bar is no longer collapsed, so the cost is a Mac's screen menus rather than all of them.

- **The settings pages ran into the scrollbar.** Every control on the right — the combos, the
  checkboxes, the opacity readout — ended flush against it, and the preview's border appeared to
  pass underneath. The page now keeps the same margin from the scrollbar that it keeps from the
  sidebar, whether or not it is long enough to scroll.

### Known gaps

Unchanged from 0.5.0, less the macOS menus above.

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is
  unaffected.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting. Handling OSC 7 would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not
  implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-08-08

### Added

- **A tooltip on each tab's close button**, naming the action and its chord, as the new-tab button
  already did.

### Fixed

- **Full screen from the zoom row looked like it did nothing.** The window went full screen, but the
  menu stayed open on top of it — and the menu is the thing you are looking at. The row keeps itself
  open on purpose, because zooming is two or three presses to find the right size; going full screen
  is done once, so that button now closes the menu, as the same button does in Firefox's panel.

### Known gaps

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Full screen is misplaced under GNOME's fractional scaling on Wayland.** JavaFX has no Wayland
  backend and runs through XWayland; with a fractional monitor scale, and more so with mutter's
  experimental `xwayland-native-scaling`, the window is sized and positioned by the compositor to
  something other than the screen it was given. JavaFX reports the window as full screen and
  correctly sized throughout, which is why nothing inside the app can see it. Maximising is

  inheriting. Handling OSC 7 would cover Windows and any shell configured to emit it, and is not
  implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-08

### Changed

- **No rule between settings rows.** A line under every row turned a page of eight settings into
  eight boxes, and the eye ended up reading the lines rather than the text. Separation is space
  now, as it is in Editora's settings — which is why the row padding grew as the border went. Row
  titles and descriptions take Editora's sizes with them, stated in px for both rather than left to
  inherit.

### Added

- **A new tab opens in the current tab's directory**, instead of always starting at home. Read from
  the shell process, the same way the tab titles are, so it needs nothing of the shell. Linux and
  macOS; Windows keeps starting at home, as it did.
- **Jump straight to a tab** with `Cmd+1`…`9` on macOS, `Alt+1`…`9` elsewhere — the convention both
  platforms already use. The last digit means the *last* tab rather than the ninth, so it works in a
  session with three tabs open. Chords and palette entries only: nine menu rows would be most of the
  Window menu, and all but the first few dead most of the time.
- **Closing a tab with something running asks first.** A tab always has a shell, so the question is
  whether the shell has *children* — an idle prompt has none, and one running `vim`, an ssh session
  or a build has one, which is what keeps this from becoming a confirmation people learn to dismiss
  without reading. The dialog names what it is about to end. Background jobs count: `sleep 60 &`
  dies with the tab just as surely. Every deliberate close goes through one place — the close
  button, the menu item, the chord, Close Others, Close to the Right, and closing the window, which
  ends every tab's programs at once. A reorder and a shell that exited on its own do not ask, since
  neither ends anything. Settings → Terminal turns it off for anyone who would rather not be asked.

### Known gaps

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **Quitting is not guarded**, only closing is. There is no Quit item, so on Linux and Windows
  quitting *is* closing the last window and the prompt covers it; macOS `Cmd+Q` reaches
  `App.stop()`, which is after the decision and while the toolkit is stopping — a dialog there asks
  a question nobody can act on. Doing it properly means intercepting the quit before `Platform.exit`.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows**, and a new tab there starts at home rather than
  inheriting. Reading another process's cwd means `NtQueryInformationProcess`, a different order of
  undertaking from a `readlink`. Handling OSC 7 would cover Windows and any shell configured to
  emit it, and is not implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Zoom is one row in the menus, as a browser does it** — `Zoom  −  110%  +  ⤢` — in both the View
  menu and the right-click menu, replacing the three separate Zoom In / Zoom Out / Actual Size
  items. The menu stays open while the buttons are pressed, because zooming is something you do two
  or three times to find the size you want. The percentage is itself the reset. The three actions
  keep their chords and their places in the command palette.
- **Zoom is now a level, separate from the configured font size.** It used to add a pixel to the
  font-size preference, so there was no "100%" to show and resetting the zoom silently discarded the
  size the user had chosen. `font.zoom` multiplies `font.size`; Settings still edits the size, and
  the zoom row moves through a browser's ladder (30% to 300%). **On upgrade, whatever size you had
  becomes your base at 100%** — a size previously arrived at by zooming cannot be told from one that
  was chosen.
- **Full screen** (`F11`, `Ctrl+Cmd+F` on macOS), from the zoom row and the command palette.

### Fixed

- **The terminal could still lose focus, by paths other than the one already fixed.** Making the
  tab strip non-traversable stopped it being *traversed* to; it did not stop anything calling
  `requestFocus`, which ignores that flag. A click on the already-selected tab header takes focus
  without changing the selection, so the listener that follows a tab switch never runs — and the
  strip's empty space, a drag that reorders nothing, and the menu bar after its menu closes all do
  the same. Every one of them presents as a window that looks ready and swallows typing, which is
  why the report behind this could not be reproduced. The terminal now takes focus back whenever
  nothing else has a claim on it; while the palette, a menu or the context menu is open, focus is
  left exactly where it is.

- **A directory listing's columns still did not line up.** Fixing the advance *within* a style run
  left the run's *starting* position measured in the wrong unit: JediTerm hands the renderer an
  index into the line's `char[]`, not its column, and the two disagree by one for every astral
  character earlier in the line — which with `eza --icons` is one per name. The drift accumulates,
  so a row with two icons ended two columns right of a row with one and the listing diverged the
  further right you looked. The emulated grid was correct throughout; only the drawing was wrong.
- **Selecting a line with icons copied text a column off from what it highlighted.** The same
  disagreement in the other direction: a mouse position and a highlight rectangle are columns,
  while a selection is handed to JediTerm, which indexes the line's `char[]`. Dragging across
  `Desktop … Downloads … Games` copied `…Game`. Whole-line and select-all were bounded by the
  column count too, which cut the tail off any line carrying more slots than the grid has columns.

### Known gaps

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows.** Reading another process's cwd there means
  `NtQueryInformationProcess`, a different order of undertaking from a `readlink`. Handling OSC 7 —
  the escape sequence a shell can send to report its directory — would cover Windows and any shell
  configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-08

### Added

- **Tabs and the title bar show the working directory**, read from the shell process itself rather
  than waiting to be told. The usual channel is an escape sequence the prompt emits, and any prompt
  framework that replaces `PS1` — Oh My Bash, Starship, powerlevel10k — quietly drops it; with one
  of those installed every tab was labelled "Termina" and none could be told from another. The title
  bar gets the path (`~/src/adl/Termina`), the tab its last segment (`Termina`), and a title a
  program sets for itself still wins. Linux and macOS.
- **Zoom In, Zoom Out and Actual Size in the right-click menu**, plus **Show Menu Bar** as a
  checkbox — the View menu keeps its "Hide Menu Bar" verb, because it lives inside the bar and can
  only be opened while the bar is showing. The right-click menu is the one you reach once the bar is
  gone, so it states which state you are in, and is now the direct way back.

### Fixed

- **Nothing could be typed into the first window until a second tab was opened.** The scene gives
  initial focus to the first focus-traversable node, and a `TabPane` is one — so it raced the
  terminal's own focus request and, on a cold launch where there is a JVM to warm and a shell to
  start, won. The window looked completely ready with every keystroke going to the tab strip. No
  part of the chrome is focus-traversable now, so the terminal is the only thing focus can land on.
- **The Linux launcher showed a stock Java icon.** `--icon` reaches the app image but not the deb
  and rpm bundlers, which regenerate `lib/Termina.png` from their own resources — the 0.1.0 packages
  shipped a file byte-identical to jpackage's generic 32×32 `JavaApp.png`. The icon is now staged
  into the jpackage resource directory, which is the only override those bundlers honour.
- **Development builds were told daily to update to the release they are ahead of.** Only releases
  are ever offered, so the version compared against has to be a release too — and a snapshot is not
  one. `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` now counts as `0.1.0` rather than sorting below it, while a genuinely newer
  release is still offered. Release candidates are unaffected: an `-rc1` really does precede its
  release.
- **Dismissing the update-check result revealed a stale "Checking for updates…" behind it.** The
  check reports twice — once when it starts, once when it finishes — and each report opened its own
  alert instead of replacing the first, so the two stacked and were dismissed in reverse order.

### Known gaps

- **Nothing is signed or notarised.** macOS will refuse a downloaded copy until it is; Windows will
  warn.
- **The working directory is not shown on Windows.** Reading another process's cwd there means
  `NtQueryInformationProcess`, a different order of undertaking from a `readlink`. Handling OSC 7 —
  the escape sequence a shell can send to report its directory — would cover Windows and any shell
  configured to emit it, and is not implemented.
- Windows is still unrun by a human. CI builds and packages it on every commit, which is not the
  same thing.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-07

First release.

### Added

- **Tabs and multiple windows.** Each tab owns its own shell; each window its own tab strip and menu
  bar. Settings, the preferences window and the theme are shared across all of them.
- **Menu bar** — File, Edit, View, Window, Help — using the macOS system menu bar where there is
  one. Menu items and key bindings come from a single definition, so the menu cannot advertise a
  shortcut nothing implements.
- **Right-click menu**: New Tab, New Window, Copy, Paste, Select All, Clear Scrollback, Settings.
  Suppressed while a program has grabbed the mouse; Shift forces it.
- **Settings window** (`Cmd/Ctrl+,`): theme, font family and size, cursor shape, visual bell,
  scrollback depth, shell, Alt-as-Meta, and hiding the tab bar. Live apply, no OK button.
- **Themes**: Editora Dark and Light (Caret & Ink), plus **Clear Dark** and **Clear Light** ported
  from macOS Terminal with colours read out of Apple's own profiles.
- **Menu bar can be hidden** (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M`), on the platforms that draw one in the window.
- **Tabs tile the window width** and shrink as more are added, with a **+** button in the strip.
- **Per-tab right-click menu**: new, close, close others, close to the right, move left/right.
- **Window title follows the selected tab**, as macOS Terminal does.
- **Optional scrollbar** for the scrollback (Appearance → Window), palette-coloured.
- Tab-strip glyphs matched in size and alignment; dragging the scrollbar no longer selects text.
- **Window size is remembered** across launches, clamped to the current screen.
- **Fixed**: a Nerd Font icon (or any emoji) in a directory listing shifted the rest of its line one
  column right, so columns did not line up between rows.
- **Command palette** (Shift+Cmd/Ctrl+P) over every menu command, plus the colour themes.
- **Debug log** in Advanced → Diagnostics, mirrored to a file beside the settings.
- **Six interface languages** (en/it/es/fr/pt/de), picked in Appearance → Language.
- **Window opacity** (Appearance → Window), clamped so it cannot hide the window that undoes it.
- **Bundled fonts**: five monospace families plus Inter for the interface, so a terminal looks the
  same on every platform. JetBrains Mono is now the default.
- Tooltip on the new-tab button; "Hide Menu Bar" no longer appears in the menu on macOS.
- **Tab reordering** by drag, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right`.
- **Tab bar hides itself** while only one tab is open, reclaiming the row for the terminal.
- **About window** and an **update check** against GitHub releases, throttled to once a day and
  disableable.
- **Selection and copy**: drag, double-click for a word, triple-click for a line.
- **Mouse reporting**, so vim positions its cursor and htop responds to clicks. On the alternate
  screen the wheel falls back to arrow keys, so `less` and `man` scroll without it.
- **Application icon**, carried into window icons and the macOS/Windows/Linux installer formats.
- **Native app image** via `-Pdist` (moditect + jlink + jpackage), and a Maven wrapper so a system
  Maven is not required.

### Fixed

- **Tab and Escape did nothing, and Tab froze the terminal.** Neither is in JediTerm's key encoder,
  and both are control characters the typed-character path drops, so they never reached the shell —
  and the unconsumed Tab moved focus out of the terminal, so everything typed after it went
  elsewhere.
- **A hidden menu bar painted over the terminal**, overlapping the first rows of output.

### Known gaps

- Windows and Linux are unrun. The code paths exist and pty4j carries every platform's natives, but
  only macOS has actually been exercised.
- Installers are not built and nothing is signed — `-Pdist` produces an app image, and macOS will
  refuse a downloaded copy until it is signed and notarised.
- Clear Light inherits four low-contrast colours from Apple's palette (white, bright yellow, bright
  cyan, bright white against its white background). Kept rather than corrected, so the port matches
  its source.
- No tab reordering, no splits, no search in scrollback, no keybinding customisation.
