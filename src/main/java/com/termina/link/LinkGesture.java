 * Which gesture opens a link.
 *
 * <p><b>Never a plain click.</b> A plain click in a terminal is the start of a selection, and once
 * a program has turned mouse reporting on it is that program's click — vim and tmux both act on it.
 * A modifier is the only press that is unambiguously the terminal's own, which is why every
 * terminal that has this feature uses one.
 *
 * <p>Command on macOS, Control everywhere else, matching Terminal.app, iTerm2, GNOME Terminal,
 * Konsole and Windows Terminal. Control is deliberately <em>not</em> the macOS gesture: there
 * Control-click is how a one-button mouse raises a context menu, and taking it would break that.
