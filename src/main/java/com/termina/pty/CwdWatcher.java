/**
 * Watches one process's working directory and reports it when it changes.
 *
 * <p>Polled rather than pushed, because there is nothing to subscribe to: {@code chdir} is a
 * syscall the shell makes on its own behalf and no signal comes out of it. The cost is one
 * {@code readlink} per session per tick — set against the repaint timer already running at frame
 * rate for every open tab, it does not register. All watchers share a single daemon thread, so tab
 * count buys threads at zero.
 *
 * <p>The callback fires on that thread, never on the JavaFX one. It fires on the first successful
 * read and thereafter only on a change, so a binding driven from it does not churn.
