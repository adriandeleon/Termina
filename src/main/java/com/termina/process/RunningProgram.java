/**
 * What a shell is running, if anything.
 *
 * <p>A tab always has a process — the shell — so "is something running" cannot mean "is the tab
 * alive". What matters before closing is whether the shell has <b>children</b>: an idle prompt has
 * none, and one running {@code vim}, an ssh session or a build has one. Measured against a real
 * shell, an idle prompt reports zero even with a prompt framework installed, which is what makes
 * this usable as a gate — a check that fired at every prompt would be worse than no check.
 *
 * <p>Background jobs count, deliberately. {@code sleep 60 &} is a child, and closing the tab kills
 * it just as surely as it kills a foreground program, so it is worth being asked about.
