/**
 * What a tab and a window are called.
 *
 * <p>Two audiences with different amounts of room, so two answers from the same inputs. The window
 * title bar can hold a path, and a path is what tells you which checkout you are looking at. A tab
 * is a hundred-odd pixels wide, and JavaFX ellipsises from the <em>end</em> — so putting a path
 * there keeps {@code ~/src/adl/Edi…}, throwing away the only part that distinguishes it from its
 * neighbours. The tab gets the last segment alone, which is what macOS Terminal shows and what a
 * directory is generally called in conversation.
 *
 * <p>A title the shell set always wins, because it was an explicit instruction: {@code vim} naming
 * the file being edited, or a long build announcing its progress, is more useful than the directory
 * both of them are obviously in. The directory is the answer for the overwhelmingly common case
 * where nothing has an opinion — an idle prompt.
 *
 * <p>Pure, and tested: every branch here is a rule about what the user reads, and the failure mode
 * of getting one wrong is a label that looks plausible and says the wrong thing.
