 * <p>It exists because keyboard bugs on this path cannot be reasoned about. What the OS delivers for
 * a chord is a question about AppKit, the input method and JavaFX's Glass layer together: macOS
 * binds Ctrl+A and Ctrl+F to its own text commands before an application sees them, and what arrives
 * — a KEY_PRESSED, a KEY_TYPED, both, or one carrying a character nobody typed — differs by chord
 * and by platform. A synthetic event proves nothing here, because the thing under suspicion is the
 * translation that produces the real one.
