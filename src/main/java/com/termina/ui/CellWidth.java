/**
 * How many terminal cells a stretch of buffer text occupies.

 * <p>Not its length. The buffer is a {@code char[]}, so a character outside the Basic Multilingual
 * Plane — an emoji, or one of the Nerd Font icons a modern {@code ls} puts before every filename —
 * takes two array slots while occupying one column. A double-width character is the opposite case:
 * one slot for the glyph, then a {@link CharUtils#DWC} placeholder for the column it spills into.
 *
 * <p>Confusing the two shifts everything after the character by a column, which is what makes a
 * directory listing's columns fail to line up while each line looks individually fine.
