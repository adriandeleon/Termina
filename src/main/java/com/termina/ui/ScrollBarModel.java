 * The mapping between the scrollback position and the scrollbar's value.

 * error that produces an inverted scrollbar — one that works, just backwards, and reads as a
 * deliberate choice rather than a bug.
 *
 * <p>Scroll origin is JediTerm's: {@code 0} is the live screen and it goes <em>negative</em> going
 * back through history, down to {@code -historyLines}. The bar counts the other way, because every
 * terminal puts the live screen at the bottom of the track: {@code 0} at the oldest line,
 * {@code historyLines} at the live screen.
