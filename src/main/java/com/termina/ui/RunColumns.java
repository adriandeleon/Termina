/**
 * The display column a style run starts at.
 *
 * <p>JediTerm hands the renderer an {@code x} that indexes the line's {@code char[]}, not its
 * columns, and the two disagree exactly where {@link CellWidth} says they do: a character outside
 * the Basic Multilingual Plane is two array slots and one column. Drawing a run at {@code x}
 * therefore starts it one column late for every astral character earlier in the line — and a Nerd
 * Font icon before each name in an {@code ls} listing is one such character, in the middle of a
 * layout whose whole purpose is that the columns line up.
 *
 * <p>The drift accumulates, which is what makes it read as a rendering fault rather than an
 * off-by-one: a row with two icons ends up two columns right of a row with one, so a listing
 * diverges further the further right you look.
 *
 * <p>Stateful across a row, because a run only knows where it starts, not what came before it.
 * Runs arrive left to right; a gap between them (the padding past the last written column) is
 * plain cells, one column each, so it can be carried across verbatim.
