# Why the cask template is overridden

JReleaser's stock cask template emits

    binary "<artifact-root>/bin/<executable>"

which is the layout of a command-line tool unpacked into a folder. Termina ships a macOS
application bundle: its executable is at `Termina.app/Contents/MacOS/Termina`, the path the stock
stanza names does not exist, and what a cask should do with a bundle is install it — `app`, not
`binary`.

The `cask.appName` setting is meant to produce exactly that stanza. It is dropped from the resolved
configuration (`jreleaser config` shows the cask with `enabled`, `name` and `displayName` and no
`appName`), so the template says it outright instead.

Two other things live here rather than in `jreleaser.yml`:

- **`caveats`.** The app is ad-hoc signed, not signed with a Developer ID and not notarised, so
  Gatekeeper refuses a downloaded copy on first launch — `spctl -a` reports `rejected`. Passing this
  through `extraProperties` did not reach the template, and an unexplained Gatekeeper dialog is a
  bad first impression to leave to chance.
- **`zap`.** Removes `~/.termina`, which holds settings and the session log.

There is deliberately no `depends_on macos:`. The bundle's own `LSMinimumSystemVersion` is jpackage's
default of 10.11, and the real floor — whatever JavaFX 26 and the jlink runtime actually require — has
not been tested. A version stated too high blocks installs that would have worked; too low lets a
broken one through. Omitting it lets Homebrew allow any macOS, which is at least not a claim.

Note that multi-line `{{! }}` comments swallow the lines that follow them in JReleaser's renderer —
the caveats block rendered as an empty heredoc until the comments were removed. Keep comments in
this template to a single line.

Regenerate and inspect after any change:

    jreleaser package --basedir .
